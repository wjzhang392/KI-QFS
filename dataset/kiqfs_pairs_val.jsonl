What is the nature of Canadian-U.S. relations on Pacific salmon fishing?", "summaries": ["In 1985 the U.S. and Canada signed the Pacific Salmon Treaty, limiting catches to salmon spawned in each country. Key provisions expired in 1992. In 1994 Canada slapped $1,000 license fees on U.S. fishermen transiting Canadian waters. In 1997 Canada and the U.S. suspended talks on a new Pacific Salmon Treaty. Canada charged the U.S. caught Canada-spawned salmon. It stepped up enforcement against U.S. vessels. Canada sued the U.S. for over fishing, which undermined Canada's conservation efforts. In 1999, Canada and the U.S. agreed to interim salmon regulations. In July 1999, the U.S. and Canada signed a revised 10-year Pacific Salmon Treaty, to share catch and protect salmon populations. In 1998 in Washington State, three Columbia River dams made passage less deadly, transported salmon around dams, reduced predators, and increased hatchery yields. In 1999, the U.S. added 10 salmon species to the Endangered Species Act. Home building, storm water management and treatment, agriculture, farming, logging, industry, commercial and sport fisheries, sea walls, shoreline bulkheads and other man-made barriers, were tightly regulated. The U.S. established a plan to restore salmon throughout the Pacific Northwest, through habitat restoration and breaching four Snake River dams. In 2000 more flexible U.S. salmon regulations added heavy fines. A proposed 10-year, $1 billion \"Lands Legacy\" preserved salmon in four West Coast states. By 2001 California removed five electric dams from Battle Creek. Three other dams got fish ladders and increased downriver flow. Hatcheries bolstered chinook stocks. Canadian salmon conservation efforts were restricted by limited funding.", "The decline of salmon populations off the Pacific coasts of the United States and Canada is one of the 20th century's environmental disasters. In 1999, the federal government acting under the Endangered Species Act set in motion a regional plan to restore salmon runs in the Pacific Northwest. The US and Canada announced a plan to limit salmon catches and establish a fund to protect the fish. Prior to this agreement, the two countries were at odds on salmon fishing. Canada had accused the US of failing to honor the Pacific Salmon Treaty of 1985 by over fishing. Also, the Canadian Province British Columbia attempted to sue the US Government for over fishing. Operators of three Columbia River dams have agreed with the Clinton administration on a 50-year preservation plan for saving salmon. The major requirement is that the dams be operated with no net loss of salmon. Dams in several parts of the Northwest are to be made more fish friendly and measurers are being taken to thwart predators like seagulls and squawfish from feasting on immature salmon. Catch limits will be imposed and prosecutions will be undertaken against the most egregious toxic chemicals dumping in rivers and streams. However, experts agree that the most effective remedy for the salmon's plight is the breaching of dams on spawning rivers. Some dams in California will be removed by 2001. That state also negotiated a habitat conservation plan with Pacific Lumber to stop logging adjacent to streams when coho salmon spawn.", "The decline of the once great salmon population off the Pacific coast of Canada and the United States ranks high on the list of 20th century environmental disasters. Over the last century, homebuilding, logging, farming, dam building, and over fishing has now led to the endangerment or threat of extinction of twenty-six species of salmon in the Pacific Northwest. The federal government responded to this development by ordering new protections under the largest and most expansive effort in the 26-year history of the Endangered Species Act. Calls for the cleaning of hundreds of waterways, the purchasing of open space in crucial watersheds, as well as tough restrictions on new construction, farming, and logging. It also may call for the closing of some federal and private dams that impede salmon runs and improvement of other dams to make them more \"fish friendly\". A permanent $290 million conservation fund has been proposed for salmon conservation programs in the West and Pacific Northwest. Local government and conservation organizations are coordinating the program with the federal government. After five years of tough negotiations and years of disputes between US and Canadian fisherman, the two countries agreed to the Pacific Salmon Treaty. This treaty revises a 1985 agreement to rebuild wild salmon runs and ensure that both sides get a fair share of the catch. It calls for two regional funds managed by both sides to improve fisheries' management and enhance cross-border scientific exploration. The US is to spend $140 million to restore salmon habitat.", "Although there is controversy on remedies, there is agreement that there is a serious decline in salmon population in the Pacific Northwest. All salmon species have been put on the Federal Endangered Species List and coho salmon is designated extinct. The causes are threefold: loss of habitat due to farming, homebuilding and dam building, overfishing, and changes in ocean conditions. The governments of California, Oregon, and Washington have implemented several programs to save the salmon. The federal government created a permanent salmon conservation fund and threatened to impose severe penalties on violators of the Endangered Species Act. A major issue revolves around dams built in the 1960s and 70s, primarily on the Snake River. Young fish cannot migrate upriver to spawn without being severely damaged or killed by concrete barriers, nitrogen gases, and spinning turbines. The federal government and environmentalists want to breach the dams returning the river to its wild state and allowing the young salmon to swim freely. Currently, scientists have devised artificial means including trucking of the salmon upstream to save some of the fish. For several years, Canada and the US have been in negotiation regarding American interception of migrating salmon headed to Canada. British Columbia sued the US for over fishing in Alaskan waters. After five years of dispute, the two nations reached agreement in 1999. Their treaty ensured that both sides would get a fair share of the catch and established funds managed by both countries to improve fisheries management and enhance scientific cooperation."]}

What is China doing to fight crime?", "summaries": ["In 1996, China began cracking down on crime. Extensive investigations and citizen tips led to hundreds of arrests for such crimes as drug trafficking; firearms, ammunition and explosives manufacturing, sales, smuggling and possession; burglary and robbery; murder; hooliganism; kidnapping; racketeering; gambling; and blackmail. The perpetrators are often gangs of thieves and criminals, and members of international criminal gangs operating between China and Hong Kong or China and Macau. In 1998, 60% of criminal suspects arrested were minors. Chinese authorities broke up a Hong Kong-based gang operating between Hong Kong and the mainland. Its leader was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death in China. Chinese authorities apprehended members of a Macau gang in its Guangdong Province. As part of its \"Strike Hard national crime-fighting campaign, China agreed to participate in the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. China revised its criminal and procedural laws and enacted new laws. Its Criminal Law was amended to include terrorist crime, organized crime, money-laundering, illegal immigrant trafficking, and environment-related crimes. China signed legal assistance agreements with 28 countries and extradition agreements with ten. China pledged increased cross-border anti-crime cooperation and urged Portugal to take tougher measures against gang-related crime in preparation for the 1999 handover of the Portuguese colony. After the handover, China will station troops in Macau to better fight organized criminal activity there. The Chinese government pledges to increase efforts to crack down on corruption, smuggling, and other economic crimes as well as criminal acts in 2000.", "Criminal activity in China in many ways is similar to the crimes committed in other countries. There are the usual criminal activities of armed robbery, murder, drug-related crimes, illegal firearms, etc. China appears to be most concerned regarding gang-related crimes, kidnapping wealthy persons for ransom and hooliganism. China crime fighting is complicated by the cross-border crime from Macau and Hong Kong, two jurisdictions soon to come under Chinese control. Police in Macau arrested three member of the \"14K triad\" gang who are close to the gang leader, Wan Kuok-koi. The three are Wong Tat-hou, Wong Wan-wa and Lam Iok-im. The gang's criminal activity has caused China to want authorities in Macau to clamp down harder on criminal activities. Members of a gang established by Zeng Qiqiang were arrested for involvement in more than 30 cases of blackmail, gambling, illegal use of guns and other crimes in South China. Police arrested Cheung Tza-keung and members of his gang who worked out of China but whose crimes were mostly committed in Hong Kong. Cheung was subsequently tried, convicted and executed in China. China has intensified its anti-crime activity through the \"Strike-Hard\" program. That nation has also signed legal assistance agreements with 28 countries and extradition treaties with ten countries.", "Beginning in 1996, Chinese police launched a major crackdown on crime, particularly homicides, robberies, rape, kidnapping, blackmail, and major thefts. Emphasis was on crimes involving the use of guns and crimes with gangster connections. In 1996 alone, Chinese courts sentenced 322,382 criminal offenders who committed crimes of violence. Hundreds of guns were confiscated and a crackdown on gun smuggling became part of the anti-crime campaign. Much of the crime was gang related. In spite of these efforts, crime and gang violence continued to increase causing the anti-crime campaign to be renewed annually with more cases being tried each year. As part of the anti-crime initiative, China began to work cooperatively with other nations to combat and prevent organized transnational crime, especially transnational firearm smuggling. To add to the difficulty of their task, China began working with the territories of Macau and Hong Kong to fight gang and organized crime before the territories became a part of main land China. Gang-related crime was common in Macau in connection with its lucrative gambling industry. The case of Hong Kong crime boss, Cheung Tse-Keung, known as \"Big Spender,\" is of special interest. Chinese police staged multiple cross-border raids arresting several members of his gang for activities in both Hong Kong and China. Big Spender was caught and charged with kidnapping, armed robbery, and murder. His trial, along with other gang members, took place in China. He and the others were sentenced to death and executed despite protests from England regarding rights of jurisdiction.", "Criminal activity in China is rising, especially murder, robbery, bombings, theft, gang activity, juvenile delinquency, and migrant felonies. Prostitution, gambling, and drug problems persist. Corruption and bribery is still widespread. Sixty percent of criminals arrested are minors. In April 1996 Chinese police launched a nationwide crackdown on serious crime with emphasis on gang-related crimes, those involving guns, and gun manufacture and smuggling. Many gangs were smashed, arrests made, and many criminals were sentenced to death or life in prison. Bank robber and killer Liao Yanxiong was executed. Property, cash, guns, ammunition, gun-making tools, explosives, and vehicles were seized. Police were often aided by tips from citizens. China passed new laws to strengthen human rights and amended criminal laws to enhance the fight against organized crime, money-laundering, terrorism, trafficking in illegal immigrants, and environment-related crime. China plans to crack down on corruption, smuggling, and other economic crimes. China wants to strengthen international cooperation in fighting crime. It signed judicial assistance agreements with 28 countries and extradition agreements with ten. Chinese and Hong Kong police jointly crushed a cross-border gang led by Cheung Tza-keung (Big Spender), which kidnapped tycoons' family members for $205 million ransom, among other crimes. Cheung incriminated his henchman Chan Chi-ho. China crushed a mainland gang related to a larger Macao gang and pledged increased anti-crime cooperation with Macao. It urged Portugal to get tougher on Macao crime before the colony's return to China in 1999, after which China would station troops there and deal more harshly with criminals."]}

{"id": "D654F", "query": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of same-sex schools?", "summaries": ["Much of the discussion regarding advantages and disadvantages of single-sex education comes from Great Britain where there is a long tradition of single-sex schooling. Britain does a rating and ranking of both public and private schools annually. Of the top 30 most highly ranked schools in the nation based on test scores, only one was coed. Many schools in Great Britain have been experimenting with different combinations of coed and single-sex education for different grade levels. Educators in both Britain and the US are still debating the pros and cons of single gender education. The advantages of coed education are that the larger schools are more economical to run. This means improved facilities and equipment such as computers and science materials can be made available. Another advantage is that students get accustomed to working with the other gender, a more natural situation and one that will be experienced in the workforce. For this reason, some British schools keep the genders separated until the final grade level and then bring them together in their last year. Single-sex education appears to have definite advantages for girls. Girls tend to be more intellectually mature than boys up to the age of 17 and are often distracted by the antics of the boys in the classroom. In addition, girls are often intimidated by the boys, don't take on leadership roles, and fall into the stereotypical gender roles of low interest in math and science. In single-sex schools, girls often excel in these subjects.", "There is statistically significant evidence that girls do benefit more from single-sex schools than coeducational. In the UK, only one in the top 30 independent schools is coeducational, and 25 of the top 30 state schools are single-sex. Educators believe that girls flourish in classrooms without boys, who tend to be less mature, and benefit from having fewer distractions. Single-sex schools, make it easier for girls to challenge the stereotype that math and science are male preserves. Research shows the young women at coed colleges tend to defer to the men in intellectual debate. Women in single-sex colleges are more likely to graduate and obtain advanced degrees than those attending coed schools. Girls' schools showed the strongest improvement in the latest British A-level examination rankings. However, girls seem to be doing better in schools these days, whatever school they attend. The declining enrollment and the resultant shrinking pool of students in single-sex schools compromise quality of education. Some educators believe that by putting the two sexes together, with the right balance, you get a better education. Traditionally single-sex Catholic schools in California are now going coed. School administrators prefer coed schools because the children fit better into their present generation and are better prepared for life. It is generally agreed that for boys, both single-sex and coeducational schools are equally good. A minor concern would be that the camaraderie boys enjoy in singe-sex schools would be lost in coed schools, once they begin competing for the attentions of female classmates.", "Generally speaking, single-sex schools have tended to produce higher levels of academic achievement. It is argued that separation of the sexes allows for less distraction in the classroom. It also emboldens females, who tend to mature earlier up to the age of sixteen, to work hard in the realization that they have a real chance of entering a career with their academic qualifications. The big argument for single-sex education is that you do not have to conform to gender stereotype. This means for women not just in science and mathematics but also in behavior generally. Some single-sex education supporters say that in coeducational schools women tend to defer to men in intellectual debate. There is also the view from parents concerned about family life or human sexuality curriculum that young students might be more comfortable discussing such topics separately. Alternately, some people believe that camaraderie among boys might disappear as soon as they begin competing for attention of new classmates. One socioeconomic factor factoring private, single-sex schools is that they can be more selective than coeducational schools in recruiting students and are able to defend their character against internal attempts by bureaucrats and politicians to reform them. Single-sex schools have gradually lost their appeal because of higher costs of private education and changing social attitudes. Most parents dislike segregation by sex; seeing it as a barrier to successful socialization of adolescents. They believe that in coeducational schools kids fit better into their present generation and are prepared better for life.", "Single-sex education is superior for girls. They are able to study without intimidation and with fewer distractions. They may feel freer to take \"traditional male\" studies and do not feel forced to defer to the boys as they can feel in coeducational classes. The women are more likely to graduate and obtain advanced degrees. Both girls and boys can forge close friendships and camaraderie in single sex institutions. Boy's schools can pursue a sporty regimen that would too \"macho\" for girls. In the United Kingdom single-sex schools are the ones performing better academically with only one school in the top 30 being coeducational before the age of 16. Single-sex schools have few negatives effects for boys or girls. Some parents in California believe sex education classes should be segregated because the students would be more comfortable asking questions. Single sex schools can encounter financial problems since they draw students from a smaller pool and providing dual systems can be expensive. Many parents dislike sex segregation and many students prefer coeducation. Girls may view an all-girl school to be a nunnery and few in the United States even consider enrolling in a women's college. Some believe coeducation better prepares children for life in the present generation. In the 1960's and 1970's single-sex schools were viewed as a barrier to successful socialization. Students in California preferred that the sex education classes be integrated and the dual classes are more expensive.", "In 1992-1994, UK testing of school performance showed that \"a disproportionate share of the best schools, academically, are single-sex,\" both public and private (sectarian or secular). Same-sex schools are inherently selective of the highest performing students. Co-ed schools which are selective perform better, too. The UK studies indicated that girls and boys up to age 16 perform equally in single-sex or co-ed academic settings. But girls perform better from age 16 on in same-sex academic environments, than in co-ed settings. This was attributed to girls' tendency toward \"lack of self-confidence\" and deference to boy's in the classroom, even in the presence of under-performing but uninhibited boys, who typically do not mature and begin to study diligently until after age 17 or 18. Women at single-sex colleges are more likely to graduate and obtain advanced degrees than women at co-ed schools. A highest-ranked UK school headmistress summed it up: \"... 16-year-old girls work a lot harder than boys,\" especially where they \"don't have to conform to gender stereotypes\", \"not just in science and maths, but in behaviour generally,\" when they \"believe that they have a real chance of entering a career with their academic qualifications, and so they are working for them.\" An untested, anecdotally proffered advantage of same-sex schools is that students are less distracted from studies if emerging sexual-tensions are avoided at least in the classroom. An untested, anecdotally asserted disadvantage is that same-sex schools \"are a barrier to successful socialization of adolescents\", and therefore overall success in life.", "Testing in the UK has established that academic achievement in same-sex schools for children up to the age of 16 years is superior to that in coeducational schools. This is attributed in part to the fact that girls mature more quickly than boys, are more disciplined in their study than boys and in a same-sex school avoid sexual stereotypes. Boys of 16 are at a difficult age, so they do better without the distraction of girls and girls do better without the annoyance of the boys. One British school experimented with coeducation but returned to its former status as a boys' school because its \"sporty regimen was too macho for girls.\" Experience in the US confirms that girls definitely benefit academically from same-sex schools while boys gain camaraderie in a boys' school that is missing in a coed environment. Studies of coed colleges showed that boys tend to dominate discussions and activities resulting in less self-confidence and less impressive career histories among women who attend coed institutions. The disadvantages of same-sex schools are primarily social and financial. Excluding half of the human race does not prepare the child for life and may hinder socialization of adolescents. Many parents dislike segregation by sex. In the US only 3-10% of female high school graduates even consider a same-sex college. And in both the UK and US dwindling enrollment and financial pressures militate against maintaining same-sex schools.", "Ratings of schools by the Financial Times of London consistently show that single-sex schools rate higher academically. FT does not present these findings as showing that single-sex education is inherently better, but these findings have been traditionally seen in England as an advantage of single-sex schooling. A big argument for single-sex education is that students don't have to conform to gender stereotypes. Boys and girls do not mature at the same rate, especially around the age of 16, a point that leads many to believe that same-sex schools are advantageous. Many supporters of co-ed schools do so because it is more like the real world environment where both sexes mingle. This has led some single-sex schools to go co-ed. Some boys' and girls' schools have merged to the extent that they share the same campus and have a few co-ed classes but retain their identity as mostly same-sex schools. In the US over the last 30 years, the number of women's colleges has dropped from 298 to 94 suggesting a dwindling belief in an advantage in same-sex education. Many of these colleges have become co-ed. Some junior high schools have decided to segregate boys and girls for sex education classes.", "Research shows that in schools where students are of the same socio-economic status, single-sex schools seem to be advantageous to girls and that for boys it does not seem to make much of a difference whether they go to single-sex or co-ed schools. Advocates of single-sex schools cite better test score. Surveys in English schools indicated that the best schools, academically, were single-sex schools. In 1992, 25 of the top 30 state schools were single-sex schools; and in 1993, 29 of the top 30 were single-sex schools. Advocates claim that girls in single-sex schools have more confidence and this contributes to their high academic performance. It is claimed that girls in single sex-schools can support each other. In addition, girls do not have to conform to gender stereotypes that they should not study science or mathematics. Another argument for single-sex schools is that girls are not distracted by boys and boys are not distracted by girls. Research shows that in co-ed colleges, men dominate classroom discussions. There is much debate about the significance of single-sex schools getting better examination grades. Research suggests that at the age of 16 girls are more mature and intellectually more advanced than boys, who start to mature at 17 or 18. Girls generally outperform girls on the GCSE -- the main examination for 16-year-olds in England and Wales. Boys, however, catch up when A-level examinations, used for college admission, are taken. Opponents of single-sex education viewed it as a barrier to successful socialization of adolescents.", "In 1992, the major survey of independent schools in Great Britain gave a boost to single-sex education. Only one in the top 30 schools was co-educational. In 1993, data for six years showed a marked trend at the top. In 1993, and for the previous five years, all but two in the top ten were single-sex schools. A1993 survey revealed the same pattern in the state sector: Of the top 30 state schools, 25 were single-sex. \"School is for learning,\" said one six-former. \"I wouldn't want to go to a school which was mixed...it would be a distraction\". A girl said, \"Girls can support each other. You don't have to play the sexes off each other.\" \"Girls thrive in girls' schools,\" said Margaret Kenyon, headmistress of a girls' school. Test score in Britain bear this out. Girls' schools dominated 1994's performance in examinations for 16-year-olds at independent schools. Headmistress Joan Clancy said, \"The big argument for single-sex education is that you don't have to conform to gender stereotypes\". Regarding girls' superiority in tests, she said, girls \"..now believe they have a real chance of a career with their academic qualifications, and they are working for them.\" United States Public elementary and secondary schools are overwhelmingly co-educational. Even though research shows that single-sex education is beneficial for girls, the few women's colleges in the U.S. are struggling. From1960 to 1990, the number of women's colleges dropped from 298 to 94. They went co-ed, merged with men's schools or closed."]}

How is tourism there affecting the UK economy?", "summaries": ["According to the British Tourism Authority, United Kingdom tourism revenue growth averaged 13 percent annually from 1985 to 1993. 1993 was a record year for tourists visiting the UK, up 4 percent over 1992. 1993 revenues rose 15 percent. A 3.6 percent visitor increase was forecast for 1994. From 1983 to 1993 UK tourism sector employment rose 31 percent, well above the rate for the entire economy. Tourism is a leading industry in the UK, being 5.6 percent of gross domestic product and earning pounds 10 bn annually in foreign exchange. It is 6 percent of UK employment. Tourism accounts for 20 percent of northern Scotland's gross domestic product and employs 20 percent of its workforce. Tourism had shown slow but steady growth until global recession downturns in recent years ending 1991. After some increasing tourism to Scotland in 1992, in April to June 1993 its tourism business sector profits, new jobs, and pay raises all rose further slightly, while most other sectors declined. The UK economy was not helped by the decline from 1982 to 1992 in the UK's tourism account foreign exchange balance (foreign visitor revenues minus UK travelers' spending abroad) from breakeven to a pounds 3.1 bn deficit. In 1993 the UK's tourism foreign exchange deficit worsened further by 8.8 percent, because the number of foreign holidays taken by UK residents rose 8 percent. UK domestic tourism remains stagnant since 1972. There is room for growth in a global tourism market expanding 5 percent annually since 1970.", "The UK tourist industry grew by 31% from 1983-1993 but Britain's 6.7% of world tourism earnings in 1980 fell to 4.3% in 1993. The UK is the fifth biggest earner of international tourist revenue. Its tourism balance-of-payments deficit widened as UK tourist spending overseas increased 40% from 1986-1993 while foreign tourist spending in the UK rose by less than 5%. Greater government support and moving upmarket was urged to regain lost market share. 1990 saw a record 17.9 million tourists spending 7.7 billion pounds. 1991's Gulf War caused a steep decline, with a partial rebound in 1992. Travel from the US was up 18%. Devaluation and promotion helped produce a record tourist year in 1993. 1994's D-Day commemoration drew 75,000-125,000 extra Americans and increased tourism earnings by 73 million. Western European visitors increased. In 1994 the tourist industry employed over 1.4 million (6% of UK employment) and brought revenues of 29.6 billion pounds (5.6% of the GDP). Of the 1000 Cumbrian farms (20%) participating in tourism, 63% consider it vitally important to their overall income. English domestic tourism had been stagnant since 1972. New Zealand's tourism is its biggest export earner at 3 billion pounds a year, helped by increased air service and strong promotion. Visitors increased markedly from Taiwan, Singapore and Korea. Singaporean and Hong Kong companies bought many top hotels. Scotland's tourism, concentrated in autumn and Easter, earns 1.75 billion pounds and accounts for 20% of its GDP and workforce. Scotland's tourism has grown slowly compared with Ireland's.", "After a sharp decline during the 1991 Gulf War, tourism in the United Kingdom began a steady rise. For example there were 3.2 millions visitors in the first quarter of 1992 and 3.6 million in the same time in 1993. In all of 1993 overseas visits to the UK were up 4% to 19.3 million. Spending by tourists also had a stead rise, with first quarter 1992 spending up 14% and first quarter 1993 up 13%. In all of 1993 overseas tourists' spending was up 15% to 9.1 billion pounds. An additional rise occurred in the summer of 1994 because of D-Day commemorations, which brought in an extra 73 million pounds. By 1994 tourism was one of the UK's leading industries. It created 5.6 % of the gross domestic product, employed 1.4 million or 6% of the workforce, and brought in 10 billion pounds in foreign exchange each year. Tourism jobs are less vulnerable to recession. Many farmers also found farm tourism vital. In Scotland the tourism rise was small but steady and provided more stable jobs. In northern Scotland it accounted for as much as 20% of the gross domestic product. A downside of tourism was a decline in domestic tourism and a rise in UK citizens going abroad, which created a travel account deficit in balance of payments of 3.7 billion pounds in 1993. The UK tourist industry was also becoming concerned that it was losing in the battle for global tourism.", "Great Britain ranks sixth in the tourist destination league. Its tourist industry grew thirteen percent between 1985 and 1992. The first quarter of 1993 was its best ever with 3.6 million visitors, up eight percent from the same period in 1992. Tourist spending was up thirteen percent in the same period. Overall, over nineteen million tourists visited Great Britain between 1992-1994, spending a record Pounds 9.1 bn. A D-Day commemoration in 1994 increased tourism earnings from North America by Pounds 73m, attracting 75,000 to 125,00 extra North American visitors. These increases were due primarily to sterling devaluation and promotion abroad of red London busses and black cabs. Heritage, countryside, arts and entertainment are the main attractions. Northern Scotland is getting more attention from tourism because it is popular and golfing there is fairly cheap. Higher expenditures by British travelers abroad, however, has led to a widening of tourism balance-of-payment deficits. Between 1986-1993, spending on overseas tourism by UK citizens increased by forty percent while spending by foreign tourists in Britain rose by less than five percent. The proportion of British holiday makers taking holidays of four nights or more in the UK fell to fifty percent compared to seventy percent in 1983. Britons tend to go abroad for sunshine and skiing, which their own country cannot provide. Part of the problem also is that UK tourism is more fragmented than the overseas package holiday industry. The English Tourist Board is urging travel agencies to give more priority to domestic holidays."]}

Restricted items included technical data on missile defense; nuclear technology; missile software systems; supercomputer technology; high-tech material used for ballistic missile nose cones, rocket nozzles and radar-evading aircraft; and certain machine tools. The U.S. banned export of laser and related company to any other country. Before the first Gulf War, the U.S. largely ignored the ban on sale of technology for military use to Iraq, according to an investigation by the Financial Times and ABC New/Nightline. \"Cocom\" was an organization set up in 1951 by NATO to control export to communist countries and their allies of products and technical data of strategic value. Involved were nuclear technology, semiconductor chip technology and machine tools. Japan disciplined Toshiba for selling leading-edge semiconductor equipment to East Germany in the 1980s. A Japanese firm also shipped missile parts to Iran during that time. In the 1980s, equipment for possible use in chemical and biological warfare by Iraq, as well as chemical antidote, were delivered by a British firm to Jordan, which was exempt from sanctions imposed against Iraq. Also shipped to Jordan from Britain were parts for ground-to-ground missiles and radar equipment. West German law banned the sale of weapons to conflict areas, which included Iraq for years.

Companies marketing sophisticated electronics or supercomputers are also often denied licenses for export. Some countries that are denied certain items attempt to circumvent the restrictions by transfer from a third party or country. Shipments of weapons systems, components, and materials for weapons construction to Iraq after the Gulf War were embargoed by the United Nations. The Japanese government barred Toshiba for sending semiconductors to 27 present and former Communist countries because it sent semiconductors to East Germany in violation of export controls. Exporting missile parts to Iran from Japan was illegal. Shipping zirconium to Chile from the US was illegal. South Africa was also barred from receiving military technology. Certain missile software could not be shipped to West German, Italy, and Israel. Export regulations exist regarding laser equipment and they have been violated by shipments to Britain, China, the Soviet Union, Italy, India and the Netherlands.

During the same period there were illegal transfers of technical information to East Germany and other Soviet bloc countries from individuals in the United States and Japan. Toshiba Company of Japan admitted exporting semiconductors to 27 communist nations. South Africa was another recipient of illegal military technology transfers. Some missile technology was smuggled in and out of the US and South Africa and eventually to China. A Japanese company was found guilty of illegally exporting missile parts to Iran. A Korean-American man was arrested for try to export nerve gas bombs and other weapons to Iran.

The size and design of the Concorde allowed for only 100 passenger seats. Just twenty of the transports were built and only British Airways and Air France flew them. The first passenger flight was in January 1976. A nine person crew provided luxury service and gourmet food and drink. The Concorde could make the flight between New York and London or Paris in less than four hours and once set a record by doing it in slightly less than three. The Concorde could only fly over ocean areas because of the problems sonic booms would cause over land areas. Travel on the Concorde appealed to the \"rich and famous\" and to businessmen on a tight schedule. Low passenger capacity, limitations on routes and high costs prevented the Concorde from ever becoming a significant factor in aviation. The Concorde had an impeccable safety record until July 25, 2000, when Air France charter flight AF4590 crashed less than two minutes after taking off from Charles de Gaulle Airport. All 109 aboard the aircraft, most of whom were German tourists, and four persons at the crash site died. Air France and British Airways immediately cancelled all Concorde flights but British Airways resumed them the next day. Indications are that a piece of scrap metal on the runway punctured a tire, chunks of which ruptured a fuel tank next to two engines which ignited escaping fuel.", "On January 21, 1976, the first Concorde passenger flight occured. The fleet of 13 supersonic planes flew regularly from London and Paris to New York until July 25, 2000, the date of a tragic crash near Paris. Until then, the Concorde exhibited some minor problems, but had a perfect safety record. The Concorde flew at 1300 miles an hour, making the transatlantic flight in three and a half hours. At $11,000 per ticket, primarily wealthy businessmen and celebrities were passengers. German tourists comprised most of the 109 passengers on board when the Concorde slammed into a small hotel, only two miles from the airport killing all aboard and four people on the ground. All supersonic planes out of Paris were immediately grounded. Flights from London soon resumed. A month later London cancelled all Concorde flights ending an era in high-speed travel. Investigators in France determined the probable cause of the crash was a 16-inch piece of metal on the runway that caused a tire to blow out, sending debris from the tire through the fuel tanks, triggering a fire that shut down two engines. The metal strip probably fell off a Continental plane that departed just before the Concorde. Air France filed a lawsuit against Continental for its role leading up to the crash. All bodies and debris were removed from the crash site and all victims were identified. Air France paid $20,000 each to surviving families to cover immediate expenses. 1,500 mourners gathered in Cologne for memorial services.", "The only supersonic passenger plane--the Concorde--crashed on July 25, 2000, killing all 109 on board and 4 on the ground. Developed by the French and British under a 1962 agreement, it made its first passenger flight in 1976. Twenty planes were built and 13 were still flying in 2000. A roundtrip flight cost $10,000. The plane had 100 seats and flew 1,300 mph at 60,000 feet. It took less that 4 hours to cross the Atlantic carrying the rich, the famous, and business people. It started out a technological miracle, but became an economic disaster and an elegant cultural artifact of the 20th Century. The crash was caused by a piece of metal falling off of a Continental DC10 that used the runway before the Concorde. The metal cut the Concorde's tire and flying rubber damaged the engines causing a fuel leak that burst into flame, too late to abort. It crashed into a small hotel. All the bodies were found and identified and the wreckage was moved to be reassembled. The French opened an inquiry to place blame, hearing from 295 witnesses. Almost all of the passengers were Germans going to New York. Air France paid each family $20,000 to cover immediate expenses. Memorial services were held in Paris, in Cologne, Germany, and later at the crash site. Air France immediately grounded its fleet and British Airways stopped flights on August 15. Air France was investigating modifications to insure safety and sued Continental on September 27.", "The supersonic passenger jet, Concorde, has been flying trans-Atlantic and charter routes for almost 25 years. British airways and Air France, the only companies operating Concordes, own ten and six, respectively. The needle-nosed aircraft flies at 60,000 feet and 1,350 mph completing its journey from London to New York in about 3 hours, 30 minutes. Air France's Concordes generally fly out of Paris. The cost is $10,000 for a round trip. They carry 100 passengers and a crew of nine. Most of its patrons are wealthy businessmen and celebrities, who value it primarily as a time saver. There are detractors such as cramped space because of weight restrictions, loud noise from engines and afterburners, and G-forces on take-offs. There is an unending stream of gourmet food and drink as well as rapid check-in and immigration processing. However, quick flight time leaves little time to settle in. There are no movies, video equipment, headphones or telephones, and pilots do not have the advantage of as much automation on the Concorde as their counterparts on newer aircraft. In July 2000, a French Concorde crashed immediately after take-off, the first in the history of Concorde flights. The plane struck a hotel near Paris, killing all 109 aboard and four on the ground. An investigation revealed the cause was a piece of metal on the runway that gashed a tire. Debris from the tire punctured the wing and set fuel tanks on fire.

{"id": "D346H", "query": "What are the issues related to education reform for improved student academic or vocational performance?", "summaries": ["British education reform involves a new national curriculum; competition and parental choice; and business-funded schools. Expanding the national curriculum impacts teacher workload. Parents oppose comparing school performance, longer school days, a 5-term year, and compulsory vocational training. Teachers resist \"whole-class\" vice \"child-centered\" teaching, and more practical training. Students will be streamed by subject ability. Parents want smaller class sizes, extended student loans, and better government-funded nursery schools. U.S. education reform mirrors the U.K.'s. Issues differ because states, not federal institutions, control education policy. National testing will compare public and private schools and states against \"world standards\". Critics charge national testing kills diversity, inhibits teachers; and burdens children. Federal subsidies enable school choice within states. With no new federal dollars, economic segregation is exacerbated as money leaves poorer schools. Japan balances regulating private schools with deregulating public schools. Entrance testing is equalitarian, but richer students get tutoring. Universities must value creativity over memorization, so lower schools will. A 24,000-to-1 student and researcher exchange ratio between Japan and America, underpins a $50-billion dollar trade deficit, because U.S. businesses devalue Japanese studies. Hong Kong's schools teach in English -- associated with career success. English and Cantonese standards, and subject knowledge, are all slipping. Children learn better in Cantonese (or Mandarin) or English, according to language proficiency. Singapore's well-funded schools must shift from engineering to information technologies and management; relieve pressures on students; and allow flexibility between streams. Brazil's educational mismanagement, corruption and politic abuse divert money, which produces illiteracy. Teachers boycott qualification exams.", "The basic issues involved in education reform for improved student academic or vocational performance are similar in Great Britain and the United States. They include: whether to establish state and/or national curriculum requirements; the nature of such requirements if established; what sort of testing is required to monitor students' progress and at what age such testing should start; the length of the school day and school year; how classes are to be conducted and teachers are to be trained and assessed; and if schools should be assessed and if so, how. On the matter of curriculum controversy centers on when schooling should begin, whether in early grades the emphasis shall be on the 3 R's and mastery of prescribed facts or whether the children should be challenged to creative thinking. Is the curriculum \"too complex and over-prescriptive\"? Is testing too complex, takes place too frequently and too early and takes the teacher's time away from teaching? Does lengthened class time produce better educated children or dullards? What is the proper role for team sports and individual sports? Does the curriculum stress academics to the detriment of vocational training or result in \"streaming\" students in one direction or the other? Should schools be ranked by students' test scores? Does such ranking facilitate parental choice of schools or simply disparage schools that need encouragement? Most of these issues are universal and have more than one answer.", "Educational reforms aimed at improving student academic or vocational performance, such as the use of standardized national tests, changes to teaching practices and teacher training, and reforms targeted for specific groups, raise numerous issues. Standardized national tests are used in the UK and proposed for the US. There are questions surround what testing hopes to achieve and whether it actually brings about improved performance. Other issues include the possible disruptive effects on students of test preparation and test taking, and whether testing kills educational diversity and inhibits teachers. Controversy surrounds the question of making public test results for individual schools. Teacher unions have threatened to boycott testing. Issues revolving about reforms to teaching practices include the use whole-class and subject specific teaching; the use of a \"back to-basics\" approach to counter falling standards of performance; the use a national curriculum featuring a basic core of subjects; and use of standards for academic performance to be evaluated by testing. Other issues are the size of classes, the length of school days, and the choice of schools. Teacher training issues include the proper balance between subject matter and theory taught to teachers and the amount and type of in-service teacher training needed to improve subject matter knowledge and to meet the demands of a national curriculum. Curriculum reforms for inner-city students and for vocational students are controversial. Other issues include whether to manage inner-city schools locally or centrally, and whether vocational schools are producing students equipped to satisfy the needs of industry.", "British education reform issues center on raising English language standards for both written and spoken communication, and raising mathematics and science standards. Reform recommendations include simplifying student testing, emphasizing whole class and subject-specific teaching, extensive teacher training, broadening the curriculum to bridge vocational and academic education, aiding schools in Britain's poorest areas, and a nursery education voucher system. US education reforms include developing a new national curriculum, promoting competition and parental choice in schools, and opening new business-funded schools. A first ever national examination system is proposed to measure progress. More states are now establishing standards on schools, describing and defining what students must know in order to graduate. Japanese educators are concerned that the current curriculum overemphasizes memorization while neglecting creative thought. Singapore needs to make its education system more conducive to innovation and creativity, rather than rote learning. Brazil's education system must raise standards for teachers and students and improve management and teaching by using World Bank money. Many Hong Kong schools have mixed speaking Cantonese in classrooms with using English textbooks and exams. Consequently, both language standards have slipped. Proposed language testing before secondary school would allow students with sufficient skills to be instructed in English, while the rest would be taught in Chinese. Kenya's high school graduates are not well prepared for the workforce. To remedy this, the government will add agriculture, business, home science, and crafts to the academic subjects. It also has created a ministry to support technical and vocational schools in the country."]}
