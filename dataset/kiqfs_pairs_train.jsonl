For example, from 1901 to 1989 Americans won the chemistry prize 36 times. Fifty-two the recipients in physics during the same time period were Americans. In 1990 nine Americans won prizes in the sciences. Some of the winners and their accomplishments follow. In medicine Cesar Milstein for his discovery of monoclonal antibodies, Gerald Edelman, noted brain scientist, for his work in immunology, Richard Rogers and Phillip Sharpe won for gene research which advanced knowledge into cancer and hereditary diseases. In physics, Georges Charpak won for his invention of the atom smasher, Steven Weinberger for his account of the origins of the universe, Murray Gell-Mann for work with fundamental units of matter, quarks and leptons, Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer for invention of the Scanning Tunnelling Microscope which led to MRI imaging. In chemistry George Olah for contributions to carbocation chemistry, Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman for their work on RNA. Linus Pauling is noted as the only person to ever win two Nobel Prizes, the first for his work on chemical bonds. He later won the Nobel Peace Prize. Peace Prize. Some prizes in economics have gone to Gary Becker for his work on discrimination and human capital theory, Robert Fogel and Douglass North for their work on causes of economic and institutional change, and John Harsanyi John Nash, and Reinhard Selten for Game Theory.", "Some of the Nobel Prizes awarded in recent years were: James D. Watson and Francis Crick jointly won the 1962 Nobel Prize for their discovery of the molecular structure of DNA. They shared the prize with Maurice Wilkins for his X-ray diffraction work on DNA. The Nobel Prize in medicine went to Gerald Edelman in 1972 for his work in immunology; to J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus in 1989 for finding that certain genes can be converted into cancer-causing genes; to Joseph E. Murray and E. Donnall Thomas in 1990 for their work in kidney and bone marrow transplants. Felix Block and Edward Purcell shared the 1952 Nobel Prize in physics for developing nuclear magnetic resonance. Hans G. Dehmelt and Wolfgang Paul won half of the physics prize in 1989 for trapping charged particles; half went to Norman Ramsey for his discovery of the atomic clock. In 1990, Jerome I. Friedman, Henry W. Kendall and Richard E. Taylor shared the Nobel Prize. They discovered the tiny particles called \"quarks\". George Charpak pioneered collision detectors, for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1992. Linus Pauling won the Nobel in 1954 for his work on chemical bonds. Jan Tinbergen won the first Nobel Prize in economics in 1969, jointly with the Ragnar Frisch, for the application of statistics to economics. Three game theorists, John Harsanyi, John Nash and Rheinhard Selten won the prize in 1994. The common factor for a great many winners was their American nationality.", "Nobel prizes are award each year for achievements in the physical sciences -- physics, chemistry, medicine, economics, literature and for peace.

The racially-motivated murder was committed by a gang of white males. London police were slow to act, first in trying to save Lawrence's life and later in investigating the crime. Eventually police charged three members of the gang for murder. But their investigation was so flawed that the state prosecution had to abandon the case due to insufficient evidence. Stephen's parents, Jamaican immigrants, publicly pursued justice for their son, even bringing two suspects to civil court. The death and the bungled investigation generated outrage in Britain, particularly in the minority communities. Racism in the police department was exposed. To many, Lawrence became a symbol of racial struggle in Britain, a country that had never had a civil rights movement. The Lawrence incident gained great national notoriety and became a trigger for change in the country. A play, The Color of Justice, which dramatized the incident, was extremely popular. Home Secretary, Jack Straw, announced new laws making racial discrimination an offense. He also ordered an immediate inspection of the London police force and recruitment of minorities for all police departments in the nation. Some new arrests were made in the case and the police made some financial compensation to the Lawrences for their mishandling of the case. Prince Charles launched a scholarship for minority students interested in architecture in memory of Stephen Lawrence. Unfortunately, the number of racist incidents in the UK has continued to rise.", "On April 22, 1993, eighteen-year-old black youth Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death at a London bus stop by a group of white attackers. His killing became the focus of debate over relations between police and ethnic minorities. Police acted slowly and incompetently investigating his murder. Three of five suspects in the killing were questioned and released. However, the determination of Lawrence's parents to seek justice kept the issue alive. When none of the suspects were brought to trial, they filed a civil suit against them. When three suspects were acquitted in the civil suit, the public was outraged at the incompetence of the investigation and the suspect's attitudes at the inquiry. Angry crowds protested as they testified and pelted them with bottles as they left the inquiry. A play about Lawrence's killing, \"The Color of Justice\", played to rave reviews in London. Five years after his killing, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner apologized to the teen's parents for not having brought his murderers to justice. A government report into the incident found London's police force to be rife with \"pernicious and institutionalized racism\". The report prompted the British government to order a major overhaul of the country's racial discrimination laws and their application to the police and government. Stephen's parents filed law suits against the five suspects and the Metropolitan Police over the failed investigation on the sixth anniversary of his killing. Finally, seven years after the killing, three of the five suspected killers were arrested for the murder.", "Stephen Lawrence, a promising 18 year-old son of Jamaican immigrant parents, was stabbed to death at a London bus stop in April 1993. He was attacked by five white youths with a history of race baiting. Three of the alleged killers were tried and acquitted. Charges against the other two were dropped for insufficient evidence. Police racism is believed to have led to poor handling of the case against the five. London's Metropolitan Police, according to a later government report were found to be \"riven with pernicious and institutionalized racism\". Even before the report was issued, public confidence in the police had fallen. The Lawrence murder and its aftermath served to question the common belief in Britain that its race relations are better than they are in the United States. Britain overall is 94% white and has never had a civil rights movement. In London, 20% of the population is minority but are only 2.3% of the police force. The Labor government of Tony Blair promised a radical overhaul of race discrimination laws and hoped that in ten years every police force in England and Wales would reflect the racial make-up of the area it served. Seven years after the Lawrence murder, police were cracking down on racist crime in London under an operation named Athena. In 2000, Price Charles launched a scholarship in memory of Lawrence to open up architecture, Lawrence's chosen field of study, to ethnic minorities. The Prince also expressed his deepest sympathy to Stephen's parents.", "On April 22, 1993 five young white men, used a racial epithet and stabbed Stephen Lawrence, 18, black, a promising student standing, at a bus stop in London. Police provided Lawrence no first aid as he bled to death. Police treated Lawrence's grieving parents badly. After an incompetent investigation, the case collapsed before trial. In 1996 Stephen's parents, initiated a civil suit, where three were acquitted and the other two were dismissed, which prompted widespread public outrage. The five were pelted with bottles by enraged crowds, and could face perjury charges. In June 1998 the Metropolitan Police Commissioner publicly apologized to Lawrence's parents for the botched investigation. In Feb 1999, a government report found London's police force \"riven with pernicious and institutionalized racism\". It made 70 recommendations for \"fundamental transformation\" of police race relations, such as: Officers would face heavy civil fines for racist behavior; a Commission for Racial Quality would have power to investigate police; racist language would be criminal; double-jeopardy protection would be eliminated. The Prime Minister announced a radical overhaul of race discrimination laws. A play about Lawrence's murder, Color of Justice, sold out to rave reviews. In April 1999, Lawrence's parents initiated a new civil action against all five suspects. They also sued the Metropolitan Police for the incompetent murder investigation. Police offered Lawrence's parents $78,000 each. In March 2000, three of the suspects were found and arrested to stand trial.

{"id": "D426A", "query": "What sorts of law-enforcement tasks are dogs being used for worldwide? What law enforcement agencies are using dogs? What breeds of dogs are being used?", "summaries": ["Dogs are increasingly being used in a variety of law-enforcement work. A dog's keen sense of smell enables it to be trained to identify many types of narcotics, explosives, and flammable material. Dogs can also pick-up scent from a crime scene and track persons who were at that site. That ability is also valuable in searching for missing children. Dogs can often provide a short cut to finding dangerous or contraband items that would take humans, even with sensors, much longer time to find. Consequently, dogs are used by Customs officials at border crossings and by narcotics enforcement officers and by those charged with airport and airline safety. Police also use dogs to track and apprehend criminals and for crowd control. The Belgian malinois, German shepherd, and the Labrador retriever have long been, and remain, the favorites for police work. Many of these dogs have been trained in Europe and some, especially the German shepherd, respond only to commands spoken in German. Just about any breed of dog, and even mongrels, can find a role in police work. Large dogs are preferred because they provide a more imposing presence but small dogs also have a strong sense of smell and are therefore useful, especially if access to a small, confined area is required. Other dogs used in police work are: Alsatians, Rottweilers, English Cocker Spaniels, and various mixes of pit bulls and beagles.", "Several dog breeds are used in law enforcement world-wide. The most common are German shepherds, Labrador retrievers and Belgian malinois, but Airedale-Belgian malinois mixes, pit-bulls, Rottweilers, Alsatians, cocker spaniels, beagles and beagle-spaniel mixes are also used. The tasks performed by dogs include searching passengers, vehicles, aircraft, ships and cargo for bombs, drugs and agricultural contraband at borders, ports, and airports, as well as at crime scenes or on regular patrol. Dogs are used to search for missing persons, including lost children. They track and capture fleeing criminals or escaped prisoners. Dogs augment control of protestors and prisoners. They can immediately detect trace quantities of as many as 17 different flammable, volatile liquids used in arson, in concentrations measured in parts per billion. That is 1,000 times more sensitive than portable electronic probes. A more sensitive laboratory gas chromatography analysis takes several days. It is claimed that dogs can identify individuals from samples of their scent. Agencies tout the successful exploits and human interest stories of their dogs and handlers for good public relations in the media and in schools, offset by occasional instances of overly aggressive dog attacks. Many U.S. city, county, state and federal police, fire and correctional departments use dogs for the above mentioned tasks. So do police, border and security forces in Germany, Britain, Argentina, Greece, Czechoslovakia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Mexico, the Netherlands and Italy. U.S. Customs, Border Patrol, Postal Service, Secret Service, FBI and military police also use dogs for much the same kinds of tasks.", "Dogs, with their superb sense of smell, keen intelligence and sharp teeth, play a prominent role in law enforcement in much of the western world. Their ability to sense and distinguish between different odors allows them to assist in detecting hidden explosives and narcotics and tracking down missing persons, criminal suspects and escaped prisoners. Their aggressive side and menacing teeth serve to intimidate humans and aid in crowd control or apprehending individuals. These qualities have led to their employment by police departments as members of K9 units on routine patrol or specific searches, by military, customs and border control officials, by agricultural inspectors, by security officers at airports and by riot police or military to control crowds or suppress demonstrations. Fire departments have also used dogs to identify and locate inflammable liquids in arson investigation. Although most dogs have the olfactory ability to perform narcotics/explosives seeking and tracking tasks, most law enforcement authorities prefer dogs of impressive size and high agility. The favorites are German shepherds, Belgian Malinois, and Labrador retrievers. Law enforcement dogs are most common in Western Europe and the United States, but have also been used in Czechoslovakia, Greece, Mexico, Argentina, Saudi Arabia and as far east as Singapore. In Rotterdam, Netherlands, there is a \"Smellbank\" as part of the criminal files with samples of particular humans' odors to assist dogs in their work.", "Although dogs have been used in police work for years, primarily for patrol duty, their use in detecting narcotics gained widespread acceptance only around 1980. Since then, hundreds of dogs have been trained and deployed throughout the U.S. and increasing numbers of other countries, including Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Mexico. Dogs of choice are Belgian malinois, Labrador retrievers and German shepherds. Buying and training a dog in narcotics detection costs between $3,000 to $10,000, but after the initial expenditures there is little more than food and veterinary care. The cost is minimal compared to other expenditures for high tech equipment, vehicles and aircraft employed in the war on drugs. Barco, a famous Border Patrol canine, has uncovered shipments of marijuana and cocaine hidden in frozen fish, okra, garlic and onions, and once found several hundred pounds of cocaine sealed in airtight containers and floating in a truck's gas tank. A Simi Valley canine participated in an investigation that led to 2,068 pounds of cocaine, as well as $2.4 million in suspected drug profits, the largest seizure ever there. During the six years he worked in Monrovia, CA, the canine Dandy led police to smuggled cash and narcotics valued at more than $1 billion. Besides patrolling and narcotics detection, dogs are used in many types of police work, including detection of explosives and flammable liquids, crowd control and manhunts. They have been used to pacify unruly British soccer fans and they accompany guards patrolling an overcrowded San Diego prison.", "Dogs can be trained to detect marijuana, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines. Police in the US and other counties use dogs to search for drugs. Drug-sniffing dogs are used to combat drug smugglers at international borders. US Custom agents use dogs to search trucks at the US-Mexico border and to search incoming ships for drugs. Dogs are used at airports in this country, Britain, and elsewhere, to search passengers and cargo on international flights for illegal drugs. Dogs can also be trained to detect weapons, explosives, and certain chemicals. Bomb squad units in the US and elsewhere use dogs to detect explosive devices. Dogs are used internationally at airports to detect weapons and explosives. The US Secret Service uses bomb-sniffing dogs to screen sites where the President will be visiting. Guards at military base use dogs to detect explosives. Dogs are used at fire scenes to confirm the presence of a flammable liquid. Dogs assist their police partners in searching and apprehending suspects, in finding lost children, in searching for escaped prisoners, and in drug searches. Police also use them in community relations activities They have been used by police and security forces to break up crowds and by border security to detect people being smuggled across borders. The breeds of choice, both for K-9 and narcotics work, are the Belgian Malinois, the German Shepherd, and the Labrador Retriever. Beagles, Rottweilers, and Alsatians are also used. Smaller dogs are used to search for drugs in confined places like planes and boats.", "Dogs are well-established partners in law enforcement. Their extraordinary noses make them superior to any man or man-made device in detecting substances such as narcotics, explosives, flammable liquids, and agricultural contraband. They are excellent at tracking suspects and missing persons, and add muscle to law enforcement personnel in controlling crowds. Border guards us dogs to sniff narcotics, explosives, contraband, and even hiding or smuggled people, trying to illegally pass through borders. Dogs are used in airports for the same activities, inspecting airplanes, passengers and luggage. The US Customs Service also uses dogs to inspect boats for the same things. London police use dogs to monitor potential IRA terrorist activity and to check vehicles at roadblocks for weapons, explosives, and suspects. In Europe, police dogs are used for riot and crowd control, including the control of soccer hooligans at international games. US police and military police use dogs to sniff for arson, narcotics, and explosives. On patrol, police dogs track, control, apprehend, or attack suspects and are used to investigate crime scenes. They assist in searching for missing persons. Bomb-sniffing dogs assist the US Secret Service. Prison guards use German shepherds for crowd control and to track escaped convicts. When not on patrol, many police dogs perform public relations duties in schools, senior citizen homes and hospitals. German shepherds, Belgian malinois, and Labrador retrievers are best for narcotics and patrol duties. Other breeds which assist law enforcement include Airedale-Belgian malinois mixes, Rottweilers, beagles, English cocker spaniels, beagle-spaniel mixes, and mongrels.", "City and county police agencies, customs departments, fire departments, the Secret Service, highway patrol, border patrol, military bases and some prisons in the US and many other countries use dogs to help in law enforcement work. The breeds of dogs most commonly used in law enforcement are German Shepherds brought to the US from Germany, Belgian malinois, and Labrador retrievers. Smaller dogs such as beagles are used for searching tasks. A cocker spaniel had a very successful career in California as a narcotics sniffer. 20 The dogs serve several functions. Dogs trained to sniff out narcotics are now considered a necessity in drug enforcement. Dogs have a keen ability to distinguish among hundreds of odors. They also detect bombs, and find missing persons and criminals often in easily overlooked places. Police officials claim that a trained dog can search an area for narcotics in half the time it would take five police officers to cover the same territory. Dogs are also used for crowd control by the Soviets to suppress anti-government protests, by the Italians at soccer games. Working as a team with police dogs help hunt down and capture criminal suspects. They have been known to hold on to a suspect, (or occasionally bite,) until a police officer can intervene. Arson investigators were assisted by a Black Lab who sniffed out evidence of flammable, volatile liquid in a burned out auditorium. An understaffed prison is experimenting with using dogs to keep prisoners from escaping and to protect prison staff.", "Dogs are used for a wide variety of policing tasks. Dogs are taken on police patrols first to serve as a deterrent, then to search for suspects, chase suspects, and if necessary attack and hold a suspect to complete an arrest. Dogs are used for crowd control in such places as demonstrations, sporting events, and riots. Dogs are used for tracking a suspect, missing person or lost child. One prison uses dogs in the prison to patrol with the guards and to track any escapees. Dogs are valued for their sense of smell and have been trained to detect narcotics, explosives, agricultural products, and flammable and volatile liquids. They therefore are used to search anywhere they are needed, including crime scenes, fires, border crossings, vehicles, airplanes, airports, and boats. Law enforcement agencies use dogs worldwide. These include police departments, highway patrols, fire departments, sheriff departments, and airport security. Specific US federal organizations using dogs include the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Secret Service, Customs Service, and Postal Service. The military also uses dogs. Most organizations prefer larger dogs. German shepherds, Belgian malinois, rottweilers, and Labradors are popular, as are mixed large breeds such a pit bull mix and an Airedale-Belgian malinois mix. Some smaller dogs are used, especially for drug detection in small, confined spaces such as airplanes and boats. Small dogs used include English cocker Spaniels, beagles, and beagle-Spaniel mixes.", "Dogs perform many different law-enforcement tasks around the world. They are used by border patrol officers and customs officials to sniff out evidence of drugs aboard ships, airplanes, trains, trucks, and automobiles. Airport security officers use drug-sniffing dogs to detect drugs in bags, suitcases, parcels, or on passengers. State and local police officials use drug-sniffing dogs in narcotic searches. Military police have detection dogs stationed at the entrance to military facilities to search for drugs, contraband, or explosives. Local and city police use attack dogs when patrolling or chasing and searching for crime suspects. Such dogs cannot only track the suspects but are trained to tackle them as well. They are also used for crowd control against rioters or unruly protesters. Vapor sniffing dogs are used by arson investigators to detect the presence of flammable liquids. Bomb-sniffing dogs are used by police to locate explosive devices or to help in bomb explosion investigations. Prison officials use guard dogs and tracker dogs for patrols and to search for escaped prisoners. Attack dogs are used in Eastern Europe by police-state officers to subdue human rights activists and opposition forces in banned demonstrations. Currently, at least in Italy, police use dogs to contain soccer hooligans. On the milder side, in the interest of public relations in the US, K-9 officers will demonstrate police dog skills for students in public schools. The dog breed most commonly used in law enforcement is the German Shepherd. Others include Belgian Malinoise, Labradors, Alsatians, Rottweillers, beagles, and airdailes."]}

Greenhouse gas emissions created by burning of coal, gas and oil were believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause warming of the Earth's surface which could result in increased frequency and intensity of storms, floods, heat waves, droughts, increase in malaria zones, rise in sea levels, northward movement of some species and extinction of others. Some scientists, however, argued that there was no real evidence of global warming and others accepted it as a fact but attributed it to natural causes rather than human activity. In 1998 a petition signed by 17,000 U.S. scientists concluded that there is no basis for believing (1) that atmospheric CO2 is causing a dangerous climb in global temperatures, (2) that greater concentrations of CO2 would be harmful, or (3) that human activity leads to global warming in the first place. By 1999 an intermediate position emerged attributing global warming to a shift in atmospheric circulation patterns that could be caused by either natural influences such as solar radiation or human activity such as CO2 emissions. By 2000 opponents of programs to cut back greenhouse emissions admitted that there was evidence of global warming but questioned its cause and dire consequences. Proponents of plans to control emissions to a large extent admitted that the size of the human contribution to global warming is not yet known.", "By 2000 most climate scientists agreed that the Earth's atmosphere warmed about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the 1990s alone. Earlier debates about conflicting evidence for atmospheric warming were resolved when weather satellite data were recalibrated. Also agreed is that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are rising -- 360 parts per million, up from 315 ppm in the late 1950s; that carbon dioxide (CO2) is nearly 30% higher than before the Industrial Revolution and the highest in the last 420,000 years. Agriculturally produced methane and nitrous oxide make up 8% of greenhouse gases, small compared to C02. Atmospheric angular momentum correlates with atmospheric temperature rises. All agree that we don't yet know definitively what is causing global warming. The debate is not sharply polarized, but a broad spectrum of nuanced scientific views, always open to new evidence. The dominant scientific view, expressed by a U.N. science panel, concluded that increased man-made greenhouse gases, especially CO2 from fossil fuel burning, are significant causes of rapid global warming, which if not reduced, would raise global temperature by 2.3 to 7.2 degrees over the next 100 years. In 2000, the U.S. EPA concluded that fossil fuel burning contributes to global warming. A significant minority -- over 170,000 scientists -- have questioned the accuracy of climate models predicting dangerous heat-raising effects of man-made greenhouse gases. They said naturally-produced water vapor is far more significant, and that doubling atmospheric CO2 would add only 1 degree Fahrenheit by 2100 -- near the low end of opponents' estimates.", "Global warming is thought to be at least partly caused by emissions of waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide, produced by burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. These emissions trap solar radiation and produce a greenhouse effect. Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture (ruminants and manure) make up 8% of greenhouse gases. Controls on sulfur dioxide emissions reduce a balancing cooling effect. Global warming already causes more frequent El Nino appearances, receding shorelines, longer warm seasons, and a slower earth spin. It affects habitats and threatens marine life. If emissions are not reduced, average surface temperature will rise 2-6 degrees over the next century, bringing widespread climatic, ecological and economic dislocation. Floods and droughts will increase in frequency and intensity. Melting polar ice will cause rising sea levels and coastal flooding. Malaria will increase. Rates of habitat loss and species extinction will increase. Communities will need to adapt to new conditions. Skeptics argue that human activities have little influence on climate. Most observed warming is due to natural causes like changes in solar radiation or the circulation of heat-bearing ocean waters. Measurements taken by satellites have found little temperature rise in the upper atmosphere. Computer models are unreliable. Any warming over the next century would be most pronounced in the winter, at night, and in sub-Arctic regions, doing little harm and creating benefits like longer growing seasons and faster plant growth. Industry argues that reducing the use of fossil fuels would cause economic harm to consumers.", "There is wide agreement by scientists that the average temperature of the earth's surface has risen some 1.2 degrees over the past century. There is a wide range of opinion, however, as to what is actually causing this global warming and what its direct effects are. Global warming is the change in climate generally thought to occur mostly from the release of methane and nitrous oxide and especially carbon dioxide gas from agriculture. The result is retention of heat in the atmosphere. However, there is a dominant view that surface warming is at least partly due to human activities; namely, the emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. A UN scientific panel has predicted that unless these greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, the earth's average surface temperature will rise by some 2 to 6 degrees F over the next century. The panel says that the warming would touch off widespread disruptions in climate and weather causing the melting of polar ice packs. This, in turn, would cause widespread flooding and droughts threatening ecosystems that support marine life and numerous animal species. Studies also show that wind changes due to global warming are responsible for a one-third slowing down of the Earth's spin. Skeptics say that global warming is wholly natural, that there is no significant human influence on global climate, and any future warming may be inconsequential. They do agree, however, that fossil fuel burning should be reduced."]}

Labour called on parties to nominate equal numbers of men and women and endorsed the \"additional members\" system. The Electoral Reform Commission suggested a single transferable vote system with multi-member constituencies or the \"additional member\" system. A female Tory MP's proposal for bigger constituencies, each with one male and one female MP, was met with derision by her party. After all major parties fielded more female candidates that year, the number of woman MPs rose from 44 to 57. Labour's woman MPs increased their representation on the 18-member shadow cabinet from four to five. In the United States there were only two female senators at the beginning of 1992 but eleven women ran for seats that year and the total reached six in the 100-member body. The parliament of Poland chose its first female prime minister in 1992 while in Pakistan, with only two woman members in its 217-seat lower house, the government pushed a constitutional amendment reserving 20 seats for women. Japan saw a reduction in the number of woman candidates in 1992 and although Turkey elected its first woman prime minister the following year, there were only eight women in its 450-member parliament. Switzerland's parliament in 1993 voted down one woman cabinet candidate, then voted in another to become the second woman minister in Swiss history.", "In the early 1990s, women were poorly represented in many parliaments. In 1992, less than nine percent of the MPs in the UK parliament were women, six percent of the US Senate were women, and less than 1 percent of both the upper and lower houses of parliament in Pakistan were women. In 1993, less than two percent of the deputies in the Turkish parliament were women. While women made some progress in gaining political power, such as the election of a woman prime minister in Poland in 1992 and in Turkey in 1993, they made little headway in traditional, male-dominated countries. In 1992, the number of women candidates for the Japanese upper house decreased by half. In 1993, members of the Swiss parliament rejected a women from the country's cabinet because of her feminist life style. Several countries considered election system reforms to raise the percentages of women in parliaments. One reform considered in the UK was the list system where female candidates are stacked at or near the top of a political party's list. Another was the additional member system featuring both directly elected and party appointed representatives. Quota systems to ensure gender equality were proposed for the Turkish parliament and for parties of the planned Scottish parliament. Pakistan considered reserving 20 seats for women in its lower house. Countries as the US relied on political processes rather than quotas for increasing the number of female candidates. The 1992 Senate election featured a record 11 women candidates.", "Men greatly outnumber women in most legislative bodies around the world. In the United States, in October 1992, there were only two women in the Senate, but 11 were nominated to run in the upcoming election, and six were elected. In 1992, there were only two women members in Pakistan's 217 seat lower house of parliament, and one among the 87 upper house legislators. In 1992, Poland elected Hanna Suchocka prime minister, the first female ever. Tansu Ciller was elected in 1993 as leader of Turkey's largest party although there were just eight female deputies in the 450-member parliament. In 1989, the success of Takako Doi, the female Socialist Party leader in Japan, inspired parties to enlist women candidates for political office. By 1992, however, with the economy in recession, the number of new women candidates fell by half. Women's groups demonstrated when a majority of (male) Swiss parliamentarians voted down the nomination of Christiane Brunner, an MP, to join the country's seven-person Federal Council in 1993. Some nations have moved to increase political representation of women: In the United Kingdom's parliament, in early 1992, only seven percent of the members were women, but with the Labour Party's promoting of women in the March 1992 elections, 57 women MPs won, up from 44 in the previous parliament. Germany adopted a system in which at least half the seats are allocated to parties on a list basis, with women and minorities at the top of the list.", "Although women represent a majority of voters, they are underrepresented in parliaments worldwide. Elections in 1992 gave the British parliament a record 57 women, up from 44, which was less than seven percent. Shadow cabinet elections added two women, for a record five overall. Turkey elected the country's first woman prime minister, but just eight of the 450-member parliament are women. Poland's parliament also approved its first woman prime minister. In Pakistan, two women are in the 217-seat lower house and only one is in the 87-seat upper house. In Switzerland, the male-dominated parliament, after women's protests, were obliged to elect a woman to the Federal Council, the second woman minister in Swiss history. In recent US elections, women won six seats in the Senate, up from two. Women's gains have been achieved through various efforts. British gains were helped by the Labour party's requiring MPs to vote for at least three women on each ballot in shadow elections. They later proposed to increase that number to four and to create all-women shortlists for 50 percent of all winnable seats and 50 percent of those vacated through retirement. In Scotland, the Constitutional Convention proposed requiring parties to submit equal numbers of men and women candidates, and the Labour party decided to use the \"additional member\" system to achieve gender equality.

{"id": "D0627I", "query": "What are the laws, problems, and issues surrounding international adoption by American families?", "summaries": ["The 1993 Haque Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption has been ratified by 40 nations. The U.S. signed it in 1994, but did not ratify and implement it until 2000. U.S. families and their foreign adoptees struggle with race and culture identity, and racial bias. Internationally there are far more orphans than adoptive parents. Lower costs encourage adoption of children who are older, black, or female, with a premium for infant, white boys. Intermediaries increase costs from $8,000 to $100,000. African orphans are almost ignored. There is a crisis of demand for decreasing supplies of white American-born infants, due to abortion, birth control. Before abortion was legalized in 1973, 9% of unmarried births were adopted -- by 1981 only 4% -- by 1988 only 2% -- a net decline in adoptable American infants. Changes in Chinese law restrict foreigner adoptions by encouraging domestic adoption of multiple children by younger families who are not childless, an exception to China's one child per family rule. Russia tightened control over foreigner adoptions by encouraging domestic adoptions and banning intermediaries, such as the Russian Mafia. Russia exports more adopted children, mostly to the U.S., than any other country, and is the world's largest supplier of Caucasian adoptees. The ripple effect on global adoption markets could make adopting everywhere more difficult. Cambodia approves foreigner adoptions that meet the adopting country's law. Officials manipulate adoptions for personal profit. In 1998 Guatemala suspended all foreigner adoptions to protect coerced poor parents.", "The Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoptions establishes safeguards so that international adoptions meet global standards to protect children. The United States has ratified the Convention, although some US legislators proposed implementing legislation that would preclude homosexuals and others with \"promiscuous lifestyles\" from adopting children. Russia has replaced China as the nation providing most children for adoption in the US and those two countries have been amending their laws to prevent abuses in adoptions. In many cases those laws specify a one-child adoption limit and who can negotiate for the adoption. International adoption by US families notably traces to adoption of Korean orphans after the Koran War. Many US couples look to international adoptions because of a smaller and smaller supply of white American-born infants and the expense in competing for them. In many foreign countries the supply of babies exceeds the demand. Race is a factor in adoptions; many white couples are unlikely to adopt a black infant. US families rarely adopt children from Africa. The first children adopted from foreign countries had only their adoptive parents for support and often suffered from discrimination. More recently adoptive parents are screened for cultural sensitivity so that the adopted children are not shut off from the national and ethnic heritage. Now more parents are seeking guidance on the issue of race in their families. Cultural awareness events and support groups are being formed in the US.", "In July 2000, the US ratified the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, which was created to establish guidelines for international adoptions, harmonize the practices of different countries, improve the treatment of children, and curtail corruption, fraud and smuggling in the process. Russia and China, the primary sources for adoption by Americans, have recently passed laws that put tighter restrictions on the procedures for adoption. China, for example, now requires foreigners to provide extensive background information and to sign an agreement with the person or institution offering adoption and register it with the Chinese government. Russia has passed a law giving Russians more control over foreign adoptions. Russia's slow bureaucracies and entrenched problems in the adoption system could further delay the process. While designed to make their systems more credible, the Russian and Chinese laws could have a ripple effect causing would-be parents to look elsewhere, thus swamping other nations with applications. Since supply in foreign countries exceeds demand in the US, there are concerns about families looking for cheapest or \"best quick deal\" adoptions. Some children adopted from orphanages that have horrific conditions develop anti-social behavior, which prompts parents to dissolve the adoption. This could cause more governments to reconsider their policies with US families. Some adopted foreign children, mainly Asiatics, have problems with race issues, or loss of their self-identity. Parents are now required to learn how to handle race issues and be more knowledgeable about their child's native culture but not to be overly zealous in their education.", "In 1999, 16,396 adopted children came to the US from abroad. Most children came from Russia, China, and Korea. This large influx of children and a flourishing adoption industry created the need for updated adoption laws in the US and overseas and has raised many legal and social issues. Without strict legal controls, there are dangers of bribery, fraud, smuggling, and baby selling. In 2000, The UN Hague Convention on International Adoptions offered guidelines for reform, setting up global standards to protect children and improved procedures for finding them homes. The treaty was approved by US Congress in 2000 allowing federal agencies to implement the guidelines. Certification standards for adoption agencies also became more standardized. Issues have arisen about the conditions of the orphanages from which some children are adopted. Furthermore, some countries, such as Russia and Romania, set up their own laws and regulations, playing havoc with prospective parents who are awaiting their adoptive child. Most international adoptees look different than their white, middle-class parents and come from very different cultures creating issues of cultural identity and racial bias. Korea is the first nation from which US citizens systematically adopted children. These children, now adults, have described the alienation they felt because their adoptive parents tried hard to integrate them into the American culture. They felt disassociated from their birth heritage. Today would-be parents are screened for cultural sensitivity. Families join adoption-support groups and children have opportunities to attend play-groups with similar families and go to culture camps."]}

Discuss the controversies surrounding its treatment.", "summaries": ["ADHD, a common psychiatric illness that affects 3-9% of all children, is difficult to diagnose because there is no easy test like a blood test. Outward symptoms generally include impulsiveness, inability to concentrate, difficulty in learning, and restlessness. Type A is characterized by inattentiveness and distractability, Type B by hyperactivity and impulsive behavior, and Type C a combination of the two. Type D patients have symptoms that can disrupt everyday life but none that clearly fit the other three forms. Brain scans show a chemical abnormality. If approved, a 90% effective biological test monitoring activity in the front of the brain will be the first laboratory procedure for diagnosing ADHD. Behavior-modification therapy is the primary treatment in Britain but in the U.S. drugs have been found more effective. One treatment is methylphenidate (tradename Ritalin), a mild nervous system stimulant which may boost levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter, in the brain. Adderall, a mixture of two kinds of amphetamines, is effective for treating ADHD and is used largely for children who don't respond to methylphenidate. Concerta can be taken for once-a-day dosing. Clonidine is also used. Alza Corporation is manufacturing a one-a-day pill based on methylphenidate. Claims that dietary supplements help are questionable. Controversies surrounding ADD/ADHD treatment are that no one knows the long-range effects of the drugs. Some critics think the drugs are over-prescribed and suppress a child's natural spontaneity rather than correcting a brain chemistry imbalance. They also fear an increase of recreational drug use amongst teens and pre-teens.", "Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) are neurological and genetic disorders that are evident in childhood and continue through adulthood. Onset of ADHD does not occur in adulthood except through trauma. Girls have Type A, characterized by inattentiveness and distractibility; boys have type B and are hyperactive and impulsive. It is estimated that from three to five or even nine percent of children have the disorder, which twenty percent may outgrow. ADD/ADHD is diagnosed through behavioral patterns but many of those afflicted have been found to have a high concentration of a key brain protein, a dopamine transporter, which could lead to a clinical diagnosis. A clinic associated with the University of Tennessee claims a test involving monitoring the front region of the brain is 90% effective in diagnosis. An increase in the number of diagnoses of ADHD is attributed to include either hyperactivity or impulsive behavior but not necessarily both. The drug Ritalin is the most widely prescribed medication to control behavior of ADD/ADHD. The drug Adderall is used to a lesser extent and even Prozac has been prescribed. Use of those drugs to treat ADD/ADHD is highly controversial. Critics say that doctors are too quick to diagnose ADHD and over-prescribe drugs for children. Ritalin has side effects including sleeplessness and loss of appetite. Its use controls behavior, but not drug has been yet found to treat the disorder.", "ADHD, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, is a neurological and genetic disorder characterized by impulsivity, inattentiveness, and lack of inhibition and self-control. The American Psychiatric Association first described it in 1980, and some four to twelve percent of American children are now thought to have the disorder. It is three times more prevalent in boys than in girls. Those diagnosed appear to have a deficiency in certain brain receptors involved in processing the neurotransmitter dopamine. ADHD was thought to be a temporary condition for children but recent findings suggest that it may be a chronic condition that can last a lifetime and can cause difficulty with social life, school and careers. It is difficult to diagnose ADHD because there are other kinds of problems, such as anxiety and depression, that may cause the same symptoms. Primary care physicians diagnose most cases. Recently, the American Academy of Pediatrics has established guidelines to make it easier to identify those really in need of help. Stimulant-based medications; namely, Ritalin (methylphenidate), have recently been shown to be the most effective way of treating ADHD. Taken in three-a-day doses, it quiets hyperactivity by boosting seretonin, a neurotransmitter that restores proper balance with other natural brain chemicals. Medication so far appears to be more effective than behavior modification therapy when treating ADHD alone. However, problems still exist: undesirable side effects, abusive use and theft of Ritalin for psychic effects, over diagnosing and over prescribing, and accusations of parental neglect by failing to give the prescribed medication to their children.", "Attention Deficit Disorder, ADHD, has become increasingly common in American children with some 2.5 million diagnosed. ADHD, a chemical disorder in the brain, can cause impulsivity, inability to concentrate, and difficulty learning. There has been much controversy around diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. Until recently there have been no biological or medical tests to confirm diagnosis. Diagnosis was by descriptions of behavior by teachers and medical professionals. In 2000, for the first time the American Academy of Pediatrics set specific guidelines for diagnosis of ADHD. Also in 2000, a biological test was developed that monitored activity in the front region of the brain, proving 90% effective in diagnosis. Scientists use imaging techniques that measure the transporter of dopamine in the brain. Because of the inexactness of early diagnoses, some medical personnel, parents, and educators think that ADHD is being over diagnosed. Most controversial is treatment of ADHD. The most common treatments are the stimulant drugs, Ritalin or Adderall. They boost seratonin, a neuro-transmitter, levels to correct nerve imbalance. Several studies have shown that patients on these medications have improved dramatically and tolerated the drugs well. In 2000, a one-a-day pill, Alza, came on the market with the advantage of being time release. Many parents and experts, however, believe that doctors are throwing medication at children as a quick way of quieting them without trying less invasive methods such as behavior modification therapy. These people also fear the long-term consequences of the medication such as a tendency toward addiction."]}

These painful, often debilitating injuries include tenosynovitis, capsulitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, back pain, and muscle-pain-spasm syndrome. Other problems are stress, eyesight problems, headaches, and fatigue. Computer use may be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage or birth defects from low-level magnetic radiation, \"sick building syndrome,\" possibly because terminals attract dust and minerals from ventilation systems, and a high incidence of anginal chest pain for video display terminal users. To avoid problems, use good posture. Sit upright, feet flat on the floor or foot rest, knees bent at right angles, and lower back supported. Keyboards should be elbow-height.

All of these ailments are associated with prolonged use of computer keyboards. Back pain and eyestrain are also linked to use of keyboards and visual display terminals (VDTs). RSI was reported in 1992 to account for more than half of all work injuries in the U.K. and RSI cases there totaled approximately 100,000 affecting about 1 in 10 workers. In the U.S. 115,400 cases were reported in 1990. Another ailment with flu-like symptoms called \"sick building syndrome\" is thought to be caused by disturbance of insulation in buildings where computers have been recently installed rather than by use of the computer. There have also been reports of prolonged computer use causing angina and reproductive problems, but the association has not been proved. RSI and eyestrain, however, are clearly associated.

RTI refers to the painful and sometimes debilitating range of conditions affecting the neck, shoulders, arms, wrists, and hands. It is caused by performing repetitive tasks as punching a keyboard thousands of times an hour, for several hours at a time. It is also associated with extended mouse usage. RTI accounts for most work-related injuries; in 1994, more than 2,000 RSI lawsuits against computer manufactures were filed, with similar lawsuits filed in the UK and Australia. CTS is caused by repeated movements involving the wrist, such as when using a mouse and or keyboard. Its symptoms include tingling feelings and pain in the thumb, index finger, and middle fingers and a weakening of the thumb. Eyestrain is a common complaint among those who use computers frequently.

What companies are producing steel using these new technologies at so-called mini-mills? What technical and financial problems have they encountered? What companies are planning to build mini-mills which will employ these newer methods?", "summaries": ["The new technology for steel production is the mini-mill. It makes steel by melting scrap metal in electric arc furnaces and pouring it into continuous thin-slab casting machines. From there, 2-inch thick slabs are rolled directly into finished steel. The biggest benefit of the new technology is the low cost of production. The new process makes steel in a single production run, cutting out several stages of traditional manufacturing. This sharply cuts time, labor, and energy costs. Mini-mills have lower capital demands and operating costs than traditional steel manufacturers. Maverick US mini-mill producer, Nucor, has the lowest productions costs of any US flat-rolled steel producer. It achieves this with the new technology, the cheap electricity costs of its rural location, and the use of non-union labor. Other mini-mill steel producers are Chapparal, Birmingham, an Italian mini-mill group, and Co-Steel, with mini-mills in Canada, the US and the UK. A mini-mill is planned for Bilbao, Spain. Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary and the US's North Star Steel will build and operate one in the US Midwest. Trico Steel, a US-UK-Japanese joint venture, will build one in the south-eastern US. Dutch, German, and Taiwanese companies may follow. Nucor had steel quality problems at start up which were easily solved. However, steel from mini-mills is of a grade more suitable for construction than for more demanding applications, such as car-body panels. The high cost of energy and scrap metal in western Europe and Japan reduce the competitiveness of the mini-mill in those countries.", "The main new technology in steel-making involves mini-mills developed by West Germany's SMS Schloemann-Siemag. Mini-mills create sheet steel in a simplified single production run, cutting out several process stages. They start with scrap metal instead of ore, melt it in an electric arc furnace rather than coal-fired blast furnaces, and use a funnel mold to form steel into thin slabs which are immediately compressed, emerging as finished coils. Mini-mills must maintain a narrower temperature window. Product doesn't suffer traditional steel's cracks but had initial quality problems and still experiences some gummy scale. Thin-strip casting was expected to produce higher quality than thin-slab. Mini-mills produce lower-grade steel for niche markets like construction. They save time, energy, and money, undercutting integrated producers who transform iron ore into finished steel in many stages. Mini-mills' non-union labor, minimum management, and lack of high benefit packages result in lower labor costs. Nucor pioneered mini-mill technology, saving $100 million compared with integrated US manufacturers. Others who built mini-mills include Chapparal, Birmingham, Co-Steel, Trico Steel (LTV, British Steel, Sumitomo Metal Industries), a Broken Hill Proprietary/Cargill partnership, an Italian group, and Spain's Integrated Steel Corporation. Armco, US Steel, and South Africa's Iscor planned mini-mills. Germany's Treuhand considered a plant conversion. Luxembourg's ARBED replaced coal furnaces with electric. Mini-mills in Western Europe and Japan face higher costs for energy and scrap and opposition to job losses. Japan was researching direct iron ore smelting, which would eliminate expensive separate coking ovens and sinterers. Commercial viability wasn't expected for ten years.", "The new technology for the manufacture of steel takes place in \"mini-mills\". Mini-mills make steel by melting scrap metal in small electric arc furnaces, avoiding the expensive process of making pig iron and reducing the number of manufacturing steps. Instead sheet steel is made in a single production run, emerging from a caster only two inches thick. The thin slab is then passed on rollers through a furnace to make the temperature across its width consistent. It next goes to rolling mills to become coils of hot rolled sheet steel. Nucor Company in Crawfordville, Indiana was the first to pioneer the new technology and became the only major steel company to show a profit in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Sales have been rising annually. Nucor is a non-unionized plant, using fewer people in production, supervisory and administrative positions than traditional plants. Nucor was able to open another plant in Hickman, Arkansas and has been looking at cooperative ventures in Great Britain and Europe. Japan is looking into a similar manufacturing model. Mini-mills may not be as economically viable in Europe due to high costs of electricity and scrap iron. U.S. Steel and other companies are considering opening mini-mills giving Nucor plenty of competition. In the early stages of manufacturing, there were several quality flaws in the steel limiting the uses of the product. For instance, the steel was not suitable for automobile exteriors. Problems of cracking and bubbling of the steel have mainly been solved.", "The SMS Schloemann-Siemag process for producing steel was introduced in 1989. This process starts with scrap metal, liquefies it in an electrical furnace, and uses thin-slab casting. The casting involves using a tunnel mold to form molten steel in 2-inch thick slabs, which immediately are further compressed. Done in mini-mills the method takes less time, uses non-union labor and a lean organizational structure, and is less capital intensive. The mini-mills can be put in greenfield locations where electricity is cheaper. The main technical problem is quality control. The mini-mills are less competitive in Europe because of higher scrap metal and power costs. Nucor pioneered the mini-mill. Co-Steel has mini-mills in the US, Canada and UK. Other companies using or planning to use this technology are ARMCO (from the US steel group), Chapparal, Birmingham, Altos Hornos de Vizcaya in Spain, ISCOR in South Africa, EKO-Stahl in Germany, a joint Broken Hill Proprietary and North Star Steel venture, and a joint LTV, British Steel and Sumitomo Metal Industries venture. Some other new technologies for steel production include using a hot rolling mill to produce thin strip casting, which US Steel believes produces a higher quality product, and using electric arc furnaces to replace the old coal-fired equipment. The Japanese are researching a method to replace the coking ovens and sinterers using one large blast furnace with two smaller furnaces attached. They believe this method will cut costs by 10% and expected it to be operational by 2004.", "A new revolutionary steel production technology in \"mini-mills\" in smaller steel production companies in the US is yielding impressive profits and snatching from Big Steel much of the lower end US steel products market. The new technology, called thin-slab casting, sharply cuts the time and capital costs required for steel sheet production, namely by melting scrap iron rather then pig iron, then casting the steel into two-inch slabs, and rolling them into coils, all in a single production run. The technology, first developed by the SMS Schloemann-Siemag Company of West Germany in the mid-1980s, when combined with non-union labor and reduced manufacturing costs, is beginning to spread throughout the world. The mini-mills' largest market is for the production of reinforcing rods or rebars. The US companies currently using the new technology are Nucor, Chapparal, Birmingham and LTV's Trico Steel. The biggest steel producers, US steel and Bethlehem, have begun plans for the use of the system. Nucor, the leading US mini-mill group, has its main plant in Crawfordsville, Indiana and is developing another in Hickman, Arkansas. It also has a joint venture in Hunterston, Scotland. Nucor's sales by the third quarter totaled $786, rising 34% above the previous year, 1994. Non-US companies employing or planning the technology are SMS in Germany, AHV in Bilbao, Spain. Co-Steel in Canada, Broken Hill proprietary in Australia and Iscor in South Africa. The US's Trico Steel is in a joint venture with British Steel and Sumimati Metal Industries to build mini-mills in southeaster US.", "In the mid-1980s, the German company SMS Schloemann-Siemag developed a process to produce sheet steel in a single production run. The US company, Nucor adopted this process and opened a \"mini-mill\" which uses scrap metal liquefied in an electric arc furnace. This process is called thin slab casting and is quicker and less capital intensive than the traditional ore to smelter process, and reduces the cost of producing a ton of steel. Another new technology is direct-reduced iron which recovers metallic iron without the normal coke-making step. Still another new technology is strip casting which US Steel may invest in and is expected to produce a superior quality of steel. In addition to Nucor, several other companies are moving to the new technology. Among them are: AHV in Spain, Trico Steel to be formed in the US as a joint US, UK, Japan venture; a joint venture between an Australian company and North Star Steel will build a mini-mill in the US; the US Steel company ARMCO plans a plant in Ohio; the South African steel manufacturer Iscor plans to develop a mini-mill in that country; and ARBED, the Luxembourg-based steel maker plans to replace traditional coal-fired blast furnaces with electric furnaces. Technical problems that have arisen in the new technology include the need for a tighter process control parameters and the larger issue of a thin gummy scale that forms on some of the production process.", "NUCOR has pioneered a giant mini-mill in which steel is poured into continuous casting machines and, from there, straight onto a hot strip mill without having to make slabs first. NKK's Keihin steel complex developed another system replacing separate coking ovens and sinterers with a blast furnace with two smaller furnaces attached above. Iron ore powder poured into the top of the structure passes through the two small furnaces where it is sintered using gases generated when ordinary coal, rather than coke, is put into the main chamber and burned, producing pig iron. The new process is estimated to cut production costs by 10%. The most common technology in mini-mills, thin slab casting, was developed by SMS and put into use by NUCOR. Electric arc furnaces burn scrap metal, rather than ore, into molten steel which is formed into slabs just two inches thick which are immediately compressed into even thinner finished steel. The process is much quicker and less capital intensive than traditional steel-making, but depends on an inexpensive supply of scrap metal and electricity and the steel produced is not of the highest quality. Co-Steel, in addition to NUCOR, built mini-mills employing thin slab casting. Companies considering or planning such plants are: Madrid; U.S. Steel; ARRCO; Eko Stahl; a consortium of Broken Hill Proprietary and North Star Steel; a consortium of TRICO Steel, British Steel and Sumitomo Metal Industries; and ISCOR and the South African Industrial Development Corporation.", "In 1989, Nucor pioneered a process for making sheet steel that shook up the industry. The big steel companies employ manufacturing methods that require immense capital investment and many labor-intensive steps in production. Nucor uses the SMS process that makes sheet steel in a single production run, at a great reduction in cost. The steel emerges from the caster only two inches thick and some 150 feet long, thanks to the new design of funnel mold that is shaped like a convex lens. The resulting thin slab is passed on rollers through a furnace and then goes through rolling mills, emerging as coils of hot-rolled sheet steel. Nucor's process gives it a $50 to $70 per ton cost advantage over \"Big Steel,\" a huge difference when multiplied by a million tons. Critics contend that mini-mills can never match the quality of sheet steel produced by traditional methods. A study by a London-based firm concluded in 1993 that they are not likely to be competitive in Europe and Japan. Nucor, however, continued to generate profits while other steel plants closed. U.S. mini-mills, Chapparal and Birmingham, also made profits through the recession of the early 1990s. Co-Steel reported an impressive recovery in 1993. Cargill located a mini-mill in the Midwest. Three big steelmakers from the U.S., U.K. and Japan joined forces to produce low-cost steel in the U.S. Even U.S. Steel announced plans to construct a mini-mill in Ohio. Mini-mills also went up in Spain, South Africa, Italy, Germany and Holland.", "Traditional plants melt coke and ore in a blast furnace to make pig iron, which is processed into steel. Two new technologies -- electric arc furnaces and thin-slab casting -- are being used in mini-mills to produce steel. Mini-mills use scrap metal and iron as raw materials, turning them into steel in an electric arc furnace. Benefits of this technology include savings on raw material by using recycled scrap and cost savings by avoiding making of expensive pig iron. Mini-mills require less land than traditional mills and have lower capital demands and operating costs. However, they require adequate electricity and scrap metal availability, and the steel produced is best suited for special applications as construction. Traditionally, sheet steel is made by poring molten steel into a mold, shaping it into slabs, and turning the slabs into finished steel through a series of rolling operations. The thin-slab casting process produces slabs using special tunnel molding and immediately compresses the slabs into finished steel. Benefits of thin-slab casting are that is quicker, simpler, and has lower energy and labor costs than the traditional process because it cuts out several stages. However, it has tighter process control parameters, as temperature. In addition, the steel produced is best suited for the low-end of the steel market. Nucor is the largest US mini-mill steel manufacture. Co-Steel has mini-mills in the US, Canada, and Britain. Nucor, Iscor, Armco, and LTV -- teamed with British Steel and Sumitomo Metal Industries -- and other companies are planning mini-mills."]}
{"id": "D0606F", "query": "What are the most significant impacts said to result from global climate change?", "summaries": ["Climate change refers mainly to global warming, the ongoing rise in average surface temperature. There is strong evidence that this warming is due to human emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon monoxide, methane and nitrous oxide, produced by burning of coal, oil, and gas. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, ultimately disrupting the global temperature balance Significant impacts of warming are of two types. One consists of historical indicators of a widespread and long-term trend toward warmer global temperatures. These indicators include heat waves, ocean warming, rising seas, melting of glaciers, and Artic and Antarctic warming. The second type consists of events that foreshadow impacts likely to become more frequent and widespread with continued warming. One group of such harbinger events consists of changes to plant and animal populations. An example is the deterioration of marine ecosystems in the Antarctic region. Changes in ocean currents and climate changes have resulted in a shortage of feed, causing the populations of seals and penguins to drop by half. It has been estimated that one-third of all species may be lost by the end of this century. A second group of harbinger events consists of higher sea levels, more extreme rainfalls, more floods, more heatwaves, longer and more severe droughts, and more bushfires. Increased sea levels could threaten many low-lying coastal cities. Another group of harbinger events consists of those that endanger human health, as food and water shortages, increased risk of heart disease, and increased exposure to infectious diseases as malaria.", "In the U.S. heat deaths may double by 2075, mostly in the Northeast and Mid West. Allergies, cardio-vascular, respiratory and immune disorders; and water contamination illnesses will increase. Hanta virus is spreading in New Mexico and other southwest states. Lyme disease and West Nile virus are spreading across the U.S. Globally, diseases spread by more insects are killing more people. Dengue, rift valley fever, yellow fever, onchocerciasis, trypaosomiasis and cholera will spread in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Dengue and malaria have arrived in northern Italy. Malaria cases will increase by 50 to 80 million per year -- vulnerability will rise from 45% to 60% of the global population. There will be increased risk of heart disease, pulmonary tuberculosis, and other infections diseases in subtropical and tropical areas. Inuit locals have begun to suffer unprecedented allergies from the pollen of north migrating white pine. Warm regions like Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Syria, Malta and Lebanon will suffer water crisis for humans and livestock. Africa is vulnerable to famine. Arctic regions already experience reduced access to migrating walrus, seal, caribous, whale, birds, and fish. Up to 150 million people may become homeless as sea levels rise, notably low-lying coastal areas like New York City, Boston, Baltimore and Miami; Tokyo and Osaka; Egypt and southern China. Storms will force people to migrate away from their agriculture... resulting in famine. The number of people threatened by annual flooding will increase from 46 million to 92 million. Many island states may disappear .", "Global warming could transform a third of the world's ecosystems and natural habitats, causing significant loss of species. Warmer ocean surfaces would alter currents and disrupt the marine ecosystem. Such changes in the Antarctic region are causing feed shortages for elephant seals and penguins. Melting of Antarctic ice would raise the global sea level by 4 to 6 meters, causing major costal flooding worldwide. Many island states would disappear. Warming in the Arctic region has thinned upper Arctic ice from 2-3 meters to l.5 meters or less. Arctic animals are moving farther north, and hunters must travel farther, through mud and over thin ice for food. The tundra permafrost is thawing, and some sub-arctic plants are migrating north. Coral reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef, are at risk of dying. Climate change could threaten human health, indirectly by socioeconomic disruption and directly by heat waves, storms, and floods. Heat-related deaths may double. The risk of heart disease, pulmonary tuberculosis and other infectious diseases could increase in subtropical and tropical areas. Contaminated water from flooded sewage treatment plants could sicken people. Exacerbated food shortages would spread malnutrition. Stagnant pools from drought-slowed rivers could increase mosquito breeding and the spread of dengue, rift valley fever, cholera, and other diseases. African nations are particularly vulnerable, and the Mediterranean region would be one of the first areas affected. An increase in the frequency or severity of extreme weather events could cause increased property damage. Climate change would affect energy use and transportation as well.", "Global climate change has had serious impacts on the environment and human health in various parts of the world. Most of these are attributed to global warming or changes in the temperature of ocean currents-the El Nino effect. Antarctic elephant seals and penguins are starving and becoming infertile. On the Bering Sea Artic ice formerly almost nine feet thick has melted down to less than 5 feet forcing native hunters far afield to find firm ice and game that has retreated to cooler climes. El Nino and higher temperatures have brought droughts and floods in Texas, drought-driven fires in Indonesia, and devastating floods in China. Melting ice sheets have caused seas to rise worldwide, shrinking shorelines and displacing coastal dwellers in parts of the Pacific. The birthrate of polar bears in northern Canada is decreasing each year and there is large scale starvation of salmon in the northern Pacific. Much worse is forecast for the future. Climate change has also had harmful effects on human health. With global warming comes more heat stress. Heavier rainfall in Africa has caused the spread of malaria and outbreaks of Rift Valley fever while higher water temperatures off Bangladesh produced plankton blooms that cause cholera epidemics. Paul Epstein of Harvard Medical School has said \"There is clear consensus that climate plays a role in infectious diseases, and that climate change, with more warming and extreme events, will have a negative impact on public health in multiple ways.\""]}

It is an odorless, colorless liquid a thousand times more potent than the nerve agent sarin. The precursors it includes are phosphorous trichloride or phosphorus pentasulphide, both of which are used in certain pesticide productions, and diisopropyl ethylamine. VX has also been found to contain the chemical EMPTA (ethylphosphonothinonate), which has not industrial uses. In 1996, the US launched a cruise missile attack that destroyed a Sudanese pharmaceutical factory thought to be making VX nerve gas. Traces of EMPTA were found in soil samples taken after the attack. Traces of EMPTA were also found in the blood of a man killed by VX nerve gas in an attack by a Japanese cult. Iraq, Iran, and Syria are suspected to possess VX. Iraq produced it and filled it in SCUD missile warheads. The US produced large quantities of VX and Russia produced equal quantities of a similar agent called V-gas. Both countries have ratified the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention that bans development, production, stockpiling, transfer, and use of chemical weapons in compliance with the International Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The Yugoslav army is suspected of stockpiling weapons made from BZ (3-Quinuclidinyl Benzinate), a nerve agent similar to LSD. Also, some 30 tons of CH3POC12, a chemical banned because it can make sarin and other chemical agents, is missing after being taken from a chemical agent facility in Bosnia.", "Empta is a precursor for production of the deadly nerve gas VX. Traces of Empta were found near a Ugandan pharmaceutical plant in 1998. The US bombed this plant because of Sudan's ties to Iraq and Osama bin Laden. Although some research papers discuss using this Empta to produce anti-microbial agents, there is no known industrial use. A Milwaukee plant produces some for research. Other VX precursors are phosphorous trichloride, phosphorous pentasulfide, and diisopropyl ethylamine. VX itself probably existed in the US, Russia, Iran, Syria, and Iraq. It was used by a Japanese cult in a 1994 attack and in 1998 was found on Iraqi warheads at a weapons demolition site. Tons of CP3POC12, a precursor to Sarin and other nerve agents, were taken from a production facility in Bosnia in 1992. The former Yugoslavia had weaponized CS, Sarin, and BZ. These weapons probably ended up in Serbian hands and BZ may have been used in Kosovo. The Chemical Weapons Treaty governs chemical weapons. Schedule 1 items only kill people and are prohibited. Schedule 2 items are subject to inspections. Four hundred people are involved with these inspections, which include camera surveillance. Any suspected materials are to be destroyed and the destruction is monitored. Sanctions are levied on violators and NATO attacks are possible. Individual governments also ban shipment of dual-use chemicals. US and the former Soviet Union had vast stores of chemical weapons. The US is destroying its at incinerators in Tooele, Utah and Johnston Island in the Pacific.", "PETN is a chemical component in plastic explosives. Traces were found on wreckage from TWA flight 800 that crashed 7/17/96. PETN is found in many bombs and surface-to-air missiles. Precursor chemicals for nerve agent VX include phosphorous trichloride, phosphorous pentasulfide, diisopropyl ethylamine, and ethyl methylphosphonothionate, known as EMPTA. EMPTA traces were found in soil outside Khartoum, Sudan's Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Company, target of a 1998 US air strike. EMPTA was found in the blood of a man killed by VX in a 1994 attack by a Japanese cult. EMPTA has no industrial uses although scientific papers theorize use in fungicides and anti-microbial agents. EMPTA breaks down into EMPA. Aldrich Chemical Co. in Milwaukee makes EMPTA and sells it for research. Mobil Corp. and International Chemical Industries of America researched commercial applications for EMPTA. The Dutch banned a shipment of \"dual-use\" chemicals to Sudan in 1998.

{"id": "D400B", "query": "What are the environmental problems facing the Amazon rain forest and what steps have been taken to solve them?", "summaries": ["The major environmental problems facing the Amazon rain forest are: deforestation by settlers who burn forest to clear the land for crops and pasture; deforestation by loggers who clear cut to sell wood without replacing trees; construction of roads through forest to facilitate logging, mining or transportation with resultant loss of trees and pollution of ponds and rivers; and water pollution from cocaine processing. These problems threaten the world's largest tropical rain forest that is home to 30% of the world's known plant and animal species and several distinct indigenous cultures. As the rain forest is destroyed and colonists replace forest with farms and ranches, the native inhabitants are driven off the land and the plant and animal species are often destroyed. By the early 1990's governments and activists in the area of the Amazon rain forest had accepted the gravity of the environmental problems and were beginning to take steps to slow development and direct it in less harmful ways. Brazil had eliminated the subsidies that encouraged ranchers to destroy rain forest and the rate of destruction was down. Experiments with establishing fast growing eucalyptus tree farms to supply wood pulp proved successful. Many constructive ideas were abroad, but action was less evident. Concern for the rain forest was counter-balanced by social concern for the poor citizens who were claiming land for themselves by burning rain forest.", "Brazil's Aerospace Institute compiles satellite images of the Amazon rainforest's problems, such as the rates of forest clearing, reforestation, development, and the effectiveness of Brazil's forest programs. A $139bn Eximbank funded system of radar; airplanes; ground and satellite sensors; and communications networks monitors Brazil's Amazon for environmental research, border control, and drug interdiction. Brazilian programs to reduce deforestation and CO2 emission, and promote sustainable development include \"extractive reserves\" which globally market renewable \"rain-forest chic\" products (replenishable trees, produce, nuts, latex, pharmaceutical plants); discontinuing subsidies to clear-cutting for unsustainable ranches which dislocated forest people; tree improvement; pesticide controls; minimizing roads and mineral mining impacts; increasing fish pond farming; and improving law enforcement. The 1992 Earth Summit in Brazil fostered still under-funded first-world commitments to all nine Amazon countries for ecological data banks, forest protection and education programs to reduce global warming and preserve biodiversity, including \"debt-for-nature\" swaps pending debt relief. The mountains of Columbia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia face erosion and silting; a crush of oil-rush settlers; illegal cocoa fields with their herbicide and chemical run-offs; the threatened spread of cocoa plantations throughout the entire Amazon basin; and deforestation from out-dated settlement incentives in a hodgepodge of policies and contradictory laws. New programs promote tourism, and sustainable extraction of fibers, fruits and medicinal plants. Surinam is committed to unified management of its Amazon areas. Ecuador imposed protective requirements on oil exploitation in 200,000 hectares of rainforest, partially in Yasuni national park, a UNESCO biosphere reserve, in close collaboration with local Indians.", "The Amazon rain forest is a vast area in South America that includes parts of nine nations, but the greatest part of it is in Brazil. Deforestation is the greatest problem for the rainforest environment and is brought about by logging for valuable hardwood timber, by land stripping for farming and cattle raising, and by road building for access to mining and oil exploration areas. Brazil has established a Foundation for Sustainable Development and a fund for environmental protection, and has suspended tax breaks and credits that once encouraged ranching. \"Extractable reserves\" such as rubber-tapping, fruit and nut gathering have been cited as forms of sustainable development; however, these are of marginal economic return. Cultural Survival, a US foundation, tries to find buyers for these products. Agroforestry has proved to be a productive use of cleared lands and protecting the fragile soil from erosion. In some cases, the Brazil's armed forces have been employed to prevent deforestation. Brazil has also contracted for SIVAM, an elaborate surveillance and communications system to monitor environmental research, for border control and to combat drug trafficking. UNESCO has declared the Yasuni national park to be an international bioshpere reserve. Ecuador has adopted environmental regulations aimed at the petroleum industry. Bolivia has created a new Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environment. Suriname is one of eight Amazon countries to agree to develop a unified approach to management of the Amazon.", "The Amazon rainforest, the world's largest, contains 30 percent of the world's plant and animal species. The rainforest has serious environmental problems stemming from destruction of forest cover, from exploitation of the rainforest's mineral resources and hydroelectric potential, from oil exploration, from population growth, and from economic policies. These problems include loss of biodiversity; habitat destruction, less oxygen, and an increased threat of global warming all resulting from deforestation; disruption of the carbon cycle caused by forest burning; soil depletion and erosion caused by over-harvesting and loss of trees; water and air pollution caused by oil spills; and environmental damage caused by mining. Deforestation is the result of several activities, including clearing land for farming and cattle ranching; constructing roads for mining, oil exploration, and logging operations; and logging of rainforest timber. Forest burning, a widely used method for clearing land, is often the product of government actions. To encourage development, ranchers and others have received government subsidies in Brazil for burning forests. Government policies have encouraged poor farmers to settle on forestlands, where they use fire for clearing land. Many actions are being taken to solve or at least reduce environmental problems. Among them are establishing environmental and economic zoning to protect endangered species; introducing tree harvesting methods less harmful to the forest and engaging in reforestation projects; and applying agroforestry methods to cultivate profitable combinations of crops and trees to reduce soil erosion and make unnecessary slash-and-burn farming. Abolishing subsidies has virtually eliminated forest destruction by ranchers.", "Environmentalists were becoming increasingly concerned about the destruction of the Amazon rainforest during the 1880s. A major problem resulting from slash and burn agriculture was the reduction of the planet?s oxygen which contributes to global warming. Many species of plant and animal life were being destroyed, some before they had even been studied. Plants from the rainforest have been used to create many of our current therapeutic drugs including antibiotics. Indigent peoples were disappearing due to exposure to disease and loss of livelihood. Tens of thousands of square miles of virgin forest were being destroyed by ranchers and the timber industry. Spills from nearby oil drilling polluted the rivers. Economic considerations made it difficult to stop rainforest destruction in poverty- stricken countries of the Amazon. In the early 1990s Brazil, which contains the largest area of Amazon forest, the international community, and some businesses began to take action to save the rainforest. A forest monitoring system, SIVAM, now provides accurate, widespread information on the Amazon environment and its changes. The government has halted subsidies to ranchers who were turning forestland into pasture. Natural preserves have been created. Extractive reserves have been formed for managed harvesting of timber, rubber, Brazil nuts, and medicinal plants without deforestation. Accompanying the reserves are projects for education, technical aid, and financing to help people preserve the forest while benefiting from its riches. Examples of good planning are two companies that have planted tree farms in the Amazon, reforesting while creating a profitable harvest.", "The Amazon rain forest was heavily damaged by deforestation from increasing logging, cattle ranching, farming, mining, roadways, and hydroelectric projects. Forest-burning for land-clearing or charcoal production reduced Earth's oxygen and added carbon dioxide, contributing to global warming. Animal and plant habitats and potentially valuable species were destroyed. Water, soil and air were polluted by toxic waste from oil operations, logging, goldmining, and cocaine processing. Erosion from deforestation and coca growing silted waterways. Indigenous populations were displaced or killed by introduced diseases. Governments, scientists, international groups, some oil and logging companies cooperated to regulate development and counteract damage. Environmental audits were done and technical surveillance systems (including satellites, radar, aircraft, computers, and monitoring stations) were established to monitor the environmental and document weather systems. Debt-for-nature swaps were initiated. Forest management was researched and taught. Sustainable development was promoted to exploit the environment without destroying it and create jobs for locals. Environmental zoning created Indian reservations and \"extractive reserves\" to exploit forest resources (latex, Brazil nuts, valuable woods, oils, resins, fruits, medicinal plants). Forests were patrolled. Roads were limited in size and guarded against settlers. Local tribes and union groups actively resisted development's encroachment. Brazil nut use was explored. High-productivity Eucalyptus trees were developed for logging and grown in plantations. Native trees were planted and protected to preserve biodiversity and natural habitats. Environmentally-friendly practices and technologies were developed and promoted for logging and oil operations. Financial incentives for forest removal were ended and burnings outlawed. Easily-evaded fee structures for logging were revised.", "Many of the environmental problems of the Amazon rainforest result from the slash and burn cycle of clearing used by ranchers and farmers. Whenever the soil gives out, more land is cleared. The rainforest suffers great losses from wide scale logging, illegal logging, illegal mining, chaotic development, roadway construction, and hydroelectric projects. In 1987, deforestation caused 1.2 million tons of carbon to be released into the atmosphere. Currently, 40 tree species are at risk of extinction. Peru's coca fields cause 10% of its deforestation. Unterraced hills of coca trees cause erosion and deadly landslides. Coca growers' herbicides and refining chemicals wash into rivers. Oil companies, through negligence, recklessness, and intentional activities, have polluted and destroyed countless acres of rainforest. Bolivia's wood industry is unsustainable, causing its forests to dwindle. In order to preserve the rainforest, Brazil ended subsidies to ranchers for forest clearance, and made a law prohibiting landowners from clearing more that 50% of their property. Efforts are underway to teach farmers proper harvesting techniques and wean them from the slash and burn cycle. Sustainable forestry and development techniques, such as reforestation, are being employed, and environmental and economic zones have been established to protect threatened species. An effort is underway to link indigenous people's welfare to the welfare of the rainforest in order to encourage them to protect it. A technological surveillance system will be built to monitor the Amazon for environmental research. Numerous research projects in forest management are being funded by Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Bolivia.", "Deforestation of the Amazon rain forest causes a number of serious environmental problems. Namely, the slash and burn cycles by ranchers, farmers, loggers, and miners depletes the soil making it impossible to replenish the forest, causes erosion leading to floods or clogging of streams and rivers, or pollutes the water and the air which endangers humans, animals and plant life. Illegal coca fields and cocaine processing in the cleared land also pollutes rivers with illegal chemicals. Moreover, the rain forests serve as a major brake to the buildup of carbon dioxide, a principal contributor to global warming. The burning of the forests releases huge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide gas. Overall, the rain forest deforestation is destroying the last great reservoir of biological diversity on earth by the extinction of several species of plant and animal life each day. Some countries have begun to use satellite monitoring of their rain forest areas as a guide to analyzing the effects of deforestation. Another form of sustainable development involves establishing national parks and reserves, and creating clear demarcations of Indian lands. Additionally, \"extractive reserves\" are being developed wherein traditional populations can carry out harvesting of traditional products with the aid of processing facilities and the creation of overseas marketing. Multi-use land development is being taught along with the introduction of sustainable crops and soil replenishment technologies. Subsidies for ranchers are being removed and timber policies made more restrictive. Strong law enforcement programs are also underway.", "Development is threatening the Amazon rain forest. This area includes not only the Amazon itself in Brazil, but the headwaters rising in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. This area is rich with petroleum, metals, lumber trees, and hydroelectric potential. Farming (including coca), logging, cattle ranching, and mining along with the associated roads brought settlers into the area. Before the late 1980's some nations even gave land and tax credit to individuals and companies slashing, burning, and exploiting the forest. This development is reducing the world oxygen, creating carbon, contributing to global warming¸ threatening indigenous cultures, and wiping out species. International environmental concern soared in the 1980's, with international organizations involved and pressuring governments. Basin nations began to end subsidizing slashing and burning and to control pesticides. In some places, emphasis was placed on removing only renewable resources such as rubber and Brazil nuts, and raising fish. Nations were encouraged to swap debts for foreign investment in environmental projects. Forest 90 and the 1992 Earth Summit brought scientists and officials together to seek solutions. A wide range of actions can help. These include sustainable forestry (using reforestation and leaving surrounding areas intact), the creation of environmental zones to protect species, eco-businesses finding markets for the renewable resources, less intrusive mining methods, and improved government enforcement of laws and patrols of park. By the mid-1990's, local tribes were beginning to protest and sue interlopers. In 1994 Brazil contracted for an Amazon Surveillance System to monitor the environment and assist law enforcement."]}

Indonesia, the third largest tin producer, is attempting to maintain its domestic tin mining. Its state-owned Tamban Timah mine expected to return a profit in 1992, after having drastically cutting production costs. However, low tin prices forced most of Malaysia's tin miners to give up the struggle. Gopeng, Malaysia's largest hydraulic tin mining operation closed in 1992, as did the Sungei Lembing mines and the Malaysia Mining Corp. in 1993. Tin mining had been going on in Malaysia for centuries. Until recently, it was the world's premier producer. In the late 1800's, Chinese immigrants flooded in to work the mines. By 1900, it was producing 50,000 tons annually, over half the world's output. In 1900, Malaysia had 5,000 tin miners, but in1993, it had only 55. Malaysia's Sungei Lembing tin deposits were once the world's biggest single source of tin. It was originally developed by Cornish tin miners 100 years ago. It survived hardships during WW II, and reopened after the end of the war. It closed after being flooded in 1987, and was partially reopened by a Chinese-Malaysian partnership. It planned to restore full operation before falling tin prices forced its closure.", "Until recent times, Malaysia was the world's largest producer of tin. Tin mining was a centuries old tradition in the country. In the mid-19th century tracts of land were given over to tin concessions. Many Chinese immigrants came to work in the mines. In the 1960s, Malaysia was producing between 60,000 and 70,000 tons of tin annually and employing over 200,000 workers in the industry. By 1993 only about 4000 people worked in the tin mines producing less than 10,000 tons. Beginning in 1985 too much tin had been stockpiled in many countries in the world and was released on the market. Prices for tin fell dramatically and tin mining operations, particularly those involved in high cost hard rock mining, were forced to close down or cut back operation. During this same period, three countries that had lower labor costs, China, Indonesia, and Brazil raised output of tin to become bigger producers than Malaysia. Furthermore, the demand for tin for use in food storage was being replaced by glass, aluminum, and plastic. In spite of the huge drop in demand, CEOs of tin mines remain cautiously optimistic looking toward new uses for tin in plating car components, fire-retardant packaging, solders, lead-free tin alloy for gunshot, and tin bottle capsules. The Association of Tin Producing Countries met in 1993 to discuss ways to reduce global stockpiling and save the industry. Meanwhile, Malaysia has moved away from commodity production and put its capital in modern technologies, electronics, tourism, and real estate.", "The Southeast Asian tin industry has a long history. In 1857 rich deposits were found on the Malay Peninsula and the industry flourished with British concessions and thousands of Chinese immigrant workers. For example, 50,000 tons of tin were produced in Malay in 1900. After World War II, when the Japanese closed and flooded some mines, production resumed with Malaysian production in 1960 between 60,000 and 70,000 tons. Historic Southeast Asian tin producers (Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand) were members of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC), which kept prices supported until 1985 when turmoil struck the industry. That year, 100,000 tons of stockpiled tin were released onto the market. Prices and consumption began to decline while countries in other areas of the world increased production. The Soviet-bloc had been a big importer. Also glass, aluminum, and plastic began replacing tin as containers and the tin coating on tin-plated steel cans became thinner. By 1993 China and Brazil were major tin producers and, as non-members of the ATCP, were stockpiling and exporting vast amounts of tin, driving the price down. Also by 1993 the United States Defense Logistics Agency had begun selling off its stockpiles. By 1994, Malaysia was no longer a major producer. High wages and the rapid growth of other industries pushed tin off that nation's priority list. Indonesia was the world's top producer in 1991, but by 1994 China and Brazil had the lead. Vietnam had entered the tin market, but Portugal and Peru were also exporters.", "With the discovery of rich tin deposits in 1857, Malaysia gradually became the leading producer of tin in the world. The British initially developed the industry, employing hundreds of thousands of Chinese immigrants. The world's most extensively developed underground tin mine, stretching over 4,000 acres, was developed by Cornish miners 100 years ago at Sungei Lembing. By 1900, some 200,000 employees were producing over 4,000 tons of tin a year. In the early 1970s, forestry and mining produced 80 percent of the value of Malaysian exports. By the early 1980s, Malaysia was producing 60,000 tons of tin in concentrate per year while earning between M Dollars 32 and M Dollars 34 kilogram for tin exports. In the early 1990s, the Malaysia tin industry began a sharp decline -- down to M Dollars 12 kilogram. In 1993, Malaysia Mining Corporation, one of the world's biggest producers, closed its tin mines. The Malaysian government, concluding that tin was no longer strategically important, decided to no longer subsidize mining development. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia is staging an attempt to ensure survival of domestic tin mining. It now has risen to top place among the world's producers behind China. Vietnam and Laos are also exporting tin. Several factors explain the slump: the 1985 buffer stock operations collapse leaving 100,000 tons of stockpiled tin on the market; China's export emergence and the Soviet Union's absence from the import market; the US Defense Logistics Agency's selling of tin from stockpiles and the increasing use of aluminum.", "The world wide tin market experienced decreasing prices for that commodity in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The lessening demand for tin has resulted in many changes in Southeast Asian countries, especially in Malaysia. The British began mining tin in the late 19th century in what is now Malaysia. Thousands of Chinese immigrated into that country to work in the mines. Malaysia became the world's leading tin producer. In the mid-1980s 40,000 workers produced 60,000 tons of tin in Malaysia. Prices began dropping soon thereafter and efforts by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) to limit production to boost prices were unsuccessful. By the mid-1990s, Malaysia had only 2,000 workers in tin production and the output in one year was only 6,000 tons. The Malayan Mining Employers' Association which groups Malaysia's mining and smelting companies considered disbanding because of the decline of the industry in that country. The failure of the ATPC to enforce production quotas, increased production by non- ATPC members such as China and Brazil as well as the entry of new producers Peru, Portugal, and Vietnam, and the US Defense Logistics Agency disposing of large amounts of tin, all served to undermine the tin industry in Southeast Asia. The uses of tin have also been declining: aluminum now has the biggest share of the market for beverage cans and the use of tin in solders has been buoyant.", "Since 1857 South East Asia's Malaysia had been the world's largest tin producer. The boon times were 1913 to 1960. In 1985 the International Tin Council stopped price supports and dumped 100,000 tons of tin, crushing prices. Low cost mines in Indonesia, Brazil, and China outsold Malaysia, raising surpluses and lowering prices. Tin export quotas failed. High cost mines closed world-wide. Malaysia's largest tin mine reopened after an ephemeral 1992 25% tin price recovery. Tin stocks approached supply/demand equilibrium. Indonesia cut tin production costs 25% to become the top seller. China raised tin exports. World prices dropped further. In 1993 more Malaysian mines closed when government disincentives replaced subsidies. World analysts called tin a \"sunset industry\". Tin prices hit 20-year lows. On one day, no tin sold at Kuala Lumpur. By 1994 most Malaysian tin mines had closed. The U.S. continued selling its \"substantial\" tin stockpiles, while U.K. warehouses brimmed with tin. Factors leading to tin mining decline include: depleted high-grade tin reserves and high production costs outside Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Portugal; labor shortages and rising wages; Russia becoming a net tin exporter; tin market arbitrage; a strong Malaysian currency against the U.S. dollar; glass, aluminum and plastic packaging; thinner tin coatings on steel cans; and decreased tin-lead solder use. Future optimistic factors include: the International Tin Research Institute forecasting a 20% tin demand increase from new tin-zinc car plating alloys; new tin compounds for fire retardants, gunshot, solders, capsules; and a cheaper tin-steel \"Ultimate Can\".", "By 1994 tin mining in Southwest Asia was in deep decline with the worldwide market flooded by excessive exports from China and tin prices at historic lows. The Malayan Mining Employers' Association was considering disbanding with tin prices at $14.25/kilo while a price of $16.00/kilo was required to cover costs. Tin production in Malaysia that reached 60-70,000 tons in 1960 was down to 10,384 tons in 1993 and the number of workers in the industry had sunk from 40,000 in 1980 to 2300 in 1994. Tin mining had been going on in Malaysia for centuries. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese originally came to the country to work in the tin mines and in the 1890's Cornish tin miners developed the Sungei Lembing mine on Malaysia's east coast. By 1900 Malaysia (then Malaya) was producing 50,000 tons of tin each year, more than half the world's output. In the early 1980's the increasing use of aluminum in beverage cans took a hunk out of the tin market and then in 1985 a price support scheme of the International Tin Council collapsed leaving a huge stock of more than 40,000 tons of tin on the world market. Three countries with low labor costs, Brazil, China, and Indonesia, added to the glut producing the crises of the early 1990's. Tin producing countries agreed to export quotas, but China did not honor its promises, so prospects were grim by 1994.", "Malaysia was once the world's leading tin producer. Tin is part of the country's history: In the 19th century, hundreds of thousands of immigrants from China originally came to the country to work the tin mines. In the early 1980s, Malaysia was producing more than 60,000 tons of tin a year. The industry employed nearly 40,000 people But by the end of the 1994, Malaysia was almost out of the business, a victim of years of low prices, weak demand and competition. In 1994 production will probably be less than 6,000 tons, with a workforce of only about 2,000. Indonesia, China and Brazil are now bigger tin producers than Malaysia. Tin producers suffered a worldwide crisis in 1985. Tin prices dropped sharply when the International Tin Council's buffer stock operations collapsed, leaving 100,000 tons of tin stocks overhanging the market. Quotas on tin exports introduced by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) did not have much effect on pricing. The ATPC linked Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand and Zaire. Together, they produced 60 percent of the world's tin. But Brazil and China were not members. China, now the world's largest tin producer, joined the ATPC in 1993, giving other producing countries hope that China would curb its overproduction, but that country continued to pump large quantities of the metal into export markets. Vietnam and Laos also became tin producers. The collapse of the former Soviet Union, once a substantial consumer of tin, added to the producers' difficulties.", "Indonesia and Malaysia in Southeast Asia, along with Brazil, were among the world's major producers of tin into the early 1980s. Tin mining had been ongoing in Malaysia for centuries. In the mid-19 century, large tracts of land were given over to tin concessions. Chinese immigrants came to the country to work the tin mines. The tin industry was the foundation of the wealth of many of Malaysia's early entrepreneurs. In the early 1980s tin as being replaced by aluminum in beverage containers. Also thinner coatings of tin were being used to tin-plate steel cans. The tin market declined further with the collapse in 1985 of a price support scheme operated by tin producers' International Tin Council. The scheme held prices artificially high and encouraged over-production. The huge tin stocks accumulated by the ITC contributed to the decline in tin prices. Increased use of tin in solders and in chemicals was not large enough to offset decreasing demand. Tin consumption in 1993 was 90 percent below its peak twenty years earlier. Malaysia's tin industry began disappear rapidly in the earl 1990s. The main factor for declining production was low prices in the international market; other factors were rising production costs and the depletion of high-grade reserves. Mines were closed; Malaysia Mining Corporation, one of the world's biggest producers, closed all of its mines in 1993. Mining sites were turned into condominiums for the newly affluent. Indonesia's tin industry cut production costs in an effort to return to being profitable."]}

Some of these measures are modifications or additions to the school's physical plant such as installing metal detectors and surveillance cameras, keeping most doors locked, removing lockers that could be used to store weaponry, removing things that could provide concealment for a sniper. Greater involvement with law enforcement officials has led to police officers being assigned to schools. Some officers are armed and some bring dogs trained to sniff out explosives and the officers sometimes conduct weapons sweeps. Some schools have implemented a dress code that forbids \"gang-type\" and baggy clothing that could conceal weapons. Other schools have mandated use of school uniforms. Some schools require \"see through\" book bags and prohibit backpacks. Identification badges for students, teachers, and visitors are required in some areas. Schools post signs warning of suspensions for bringing weapons into schools and students who violate the rules do often receive lengthy suspensions. More schools are beginning to address the root causes of anti-social and violent behavior. They are promoting friendship and trying to negate rage. They are instituting programs to bring about conflict resolution and to stop bullying. In some areas, night sporting events and after school programs have been curtailed. Hot lines and tip boxes have been established to identify students with problems that could lead to violence.", "Some 20 states have laws requiring school safety plans. Mississippi broadened its death penalty law to include killings on school campuses. The federal Gun Free Schools Act requires states enact school safety laws to receive federal aid. Safety measures adopted by school districts include school uniforms or dress codes, student identification badges, and transparent book bags. Physical building security measures include removing lockers, on-campus armed guards, metal detectors, gun- and bomb-sniffing dogs, and video surveillance. Schools keep all but main doors locked, require visitor passes, and some have installed panic alarms. They do lockdown drills, and teachers and staff receive security training. All threats are taken seriously, and have often resulted in schools being closed. In some districts, police SWAT teams train at schools after hours, and security staff and local police maintain blueprints and of local schools. School systems are requiring accurate and timely reporting and tracking of threats and incidents. Some are using specialized to identify potential problems and repeat offenders. Other preventative measures include anti-bullying programs, mentor programs, increased school psychologists and counselors, identifying and treating troubled students before they become dangerous, and hot lines and tip lines for reporting disturbing student behavior. Children are being taught to better deal with problems before they grow into rage. One Kentucky school district posted the Ten Commandments in each classroom. Occasionally schools have overreacted, suspending elementary students for wanting to get rid of Barney the dinosaur and the Spice Girls, or kindergarteners for pointing finger \"guns\" on the playground.", "A series of well-publicized school shooting in Colorado, Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Oregon caused schools and school districts to take measures to prevent school violence and shootings. These preventive measures included posting armed security officers in schools; using metal detectors and surveillance cameras, conducting searches for weapons in schools; tightening access to campuses and improving screening for school visitors; locking most school entrances during the school day; installing a hot line and tip box for reporting incidents that might lead to violence; expelling students who bring a gun to school; requiring school uniforms; making it harder to conceal a weapon by requiring transparent book bags and forbidding baggy clothing. In addition, teachers and principals were trained on responding to armed intruders and on conducting lockdowns -- what teachers and students should do when there is an intruder and the police are on their way. The fatal shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., where two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher and then committed suicide, resulted in efforts to identify and assist \"red-flag\" children before they commit dangerous acts. The killers in the Columbine incident were isolated and picked on by other students. Some measures were taken to deter violence by emphasizing the climate at a school rather than its physical security measures. Theses included fostering an environment where violent behavior is not tolerated; teaching students social skills as anger management; introducing conflict-resolution programs; and building partnerships between schools, law enforcement, social services, parents, and the community.", "Federal government studies have shown that young people are safe in school and are 99 times more likely to be shot at home or in the street than in school. However, since the violent occurrences in Littleton, Colorado and Jonesboro, Arkansas, school officials nationwide are taking precautions to prevent violence in their schools. External safety measures include security checks by armed officers assigned to the schools, student identification cards, random locker inspections, metal detectors, panic buttons in the classrooms, video cameras on school buses, and erection of fences, increased lighting, and trimming of shrubbery around the school. In addition, school administrators are suspending any student who makes threats. Lock-down practice, where students are locked into their classrooms for protection in an emergency, has become commonplace. Some school districts are requiring school uniforms on the assumption that it would be difficult to hide a weapon in a school uniform. Canvas book bags are banned in some places. Many districts have gun-free campaigns and encourage reporting of any suspicious student behavior. They are also instituting anti-bullying campaigns. Some districts are trying a more positive approach hoping to make their students both safe and happy at school. These schools are developing mentoring programs, broadening their anti-bullying policies, adding school psychologists, and training security officers in interpersonal skills to help them connect with students. The goal is to create a positive group atmosphere and to heal troubled students. Another innovation in these schools is sponsoring a chapter of SAVE, Students Against Violence Everywhere."]}
{"id": "D360F", "query": "What are the benefits of drug legalization?", "summaries": ["Although many strong arguments are made against drug legalization, equally strong arguments are made in favor of legalization, particularly of marijuana, but also of other recreational drugs. Those in favor argue that drug money now goes to drug dealers and big drug cartels much of it in Colombia and other countries. If recreational drugs were legal, profits from the sale of drugs would go to American businesses and to the American government through taxes. Currently much taxpayer money is being spent to fight the war on drugs. They also argue that much drug-related crime both internationally and in poor neighborhoods would disappear if drugs were sold legally. Advocates use the sale of tobacco products and alcoholic beverages as examples of addictive substances already being sold legally. They even point out that the dangers from marijuana use are fewer that from tobacco and alcohol. Marijuana is also considered one of the safest therapeutic drugs for pain management. Warnings could be placed on packages of marijuana similar to those currently found on cigarette packets and advertising could be limited in a similar manner to alcohol and tobacco advertising. Some studies on the effects of decriminalization of marijuana show that rates of consumption either remained the same as before decriminalization or, in several instances, actually decreased.", "Drug legalization is a very contentious issue throughout the world. It is advocated by public, political, and private organizations at all levels of societies. Generally, the most common argument favoring drug legalization is that it would put an end to drug trafficking. It would also decrease drug use over the long term by minimizing dealers' economic activities and users' behavior such as gang wars, robbery and slayings. It is further argued that legalization would raise public revenue by developing municipal distribution centers and by decreasing the highly staggering costs of drug addiction. Legalization would eliminate drug cases that \"swamp\" the courts, pushing aside more serious criminal cases that otherwise need more attention. Moreover, it could facilitate investment in preventative measures such as Head Start programs and education which advocates of drug legalization see as an abiding long-term solution to drug use. Zurich, Switzerland, has a legalized drug program to benefit addicts through a controlled drug distribution program. A treatment center supplies addicts with heroin injections and cocaine impregnated cigarettes and also offers counseling. The program has yet to prove whether more people will be attracted to drugs or whether crime associated with it will abate. The legalization of marijuana and other \"soft\" drugs is supported as beneficial because of its medicinal value. Decriminalizing marijuana in California has saved the state half a billion dollars in arrest costs. Consumption and production of marijuana in the US is on the decrease. Selective decriminalization may be part of a viable effective drug policy.", "Many who argue for legalization of drugs that are now illegal see that as a way to lessen pressure on the country's law enforcement system. Drug cases are swamping US courts and the numbers of drug users and dealers in prison makes the US have one of the highest prison populations in the world. Present efforts to combat illegal drug activity are expensive and mostly ineffective, thus, legalization could result in money saving and redirecting law enforcement against more serious crime. Legalizing drugs would remove them from \"forbidden fruit\" category, lessen demand and make drug dealing less profitable. Supporters of legalization note that prior to the 20th century, opiates and other drugs were legal and that there was no drug-related violence. When laws were passed against drug use black markets formed that were dominated by organized crime and gangs who used violent means to sustain their domination. Use of some drugs, notably marijuana, is considered no more dangerous than using alcohol or tobacco, both of which are legal. Marijuana is said to have recognized medical use. Moreover, legalization does not constitute an endorsement of drug usage and some controls could be imposed as they are with alcohol and tobacco. Legalization is a first step in dealing with the drug abuse problem. The long-term solution to the drug problem lies in educating the populace about the dangers of drug abuse before they consider using drugs.", "Proponents of legalization of drugs argue that the \"war on drugs\" has been lost. Ethan Nadelmann, of Princeton University, wrote, in 1989, that during the preceding decade expenditures on drug enforcement had tripled and the number of Americans in prison had doubled. No other country in the western world had a higher percentage if citizens behind bars. \"Yet most aspects of the drug problem in the inner cities are getting worse\". Legalization would cut down on crime associated with the drug trade, including violence between gangs. If drugs were available in a free market, there would not be big profits to be made, and who would push drugs if there was little profit in it? With legalization, say proponents, billions of dollars would be derived from taxation of drugs that are now illegal and untaxed, and from the huge amounts saved by not wasting money on criminal justice measures. That money could be used for drug treatment and prevention. Robert Siegel, a psychopharmacologist, writes that history shows humans have always used drugs. Prohibiting them will never work. The answer is regulation, as with cigarettes. Before 1900, most drugs were legal and cheap. Some people became addicted, but it was not a tragedy for society. Criminals did not usually fight over and get rich on the drug trade. Many people favor legalization of marijuana, but not \"hard drugs,\" such as heroin and cocaine. Marijuana is no more harmful than cigarettes or liquor, both of which are legal, they say."]}

The Clinton administration weighed honoring the dead mother's wishes in bringing Elian to freedom and placating the Cuban exile community, or bending to Cuban pressure and strengthening Cuban-American relations. Vietnam demanded Elian be returned to Cuba. Based on US and international law, the INS ruled that Elian belonged with his father and should be returned to Cuba. The Miami relatives insisted Elian didn't want to return and appealed to Attorney General Janet Reno. Reno upheld the father's right to custody and ignored Florida court interference, stating immigration was a federal matter. The relatives challenged the INS ruling, then appealed their suit's dismissal. Reno met with the relatives and ordered them to surrender Elian.

On January 12, Reno upheld Elian's father's right to custody, telling the Florida courts they have no say in this federal matter. On January 19, Lazaro Gonzalez challenged the INS ruling. On March 21, a U.S. District Judge dismissed Lazaro Gonzales' lawsuit. The Miami relatives appealed. On April 17, The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry demanded the U.S. end its Cuba embargo and honor the 1995 Immigration Agreement by returning to Cuba all illegal Cuban deportees. On April 22, federal agents forcefully seized Elian and reunited him with his father in Washington. On June 1, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled for the government and Elian's father. On June 28, the Supreme Court rejected a final appeal; Elian returned home to Cuba, was celebrated in the media and returned to his home and schooling."]}

How did their parent companies fare?", "summaries": ["American companies began looking overseas for sales in the early 90s. By 1992, worldwide sales of international brands, led by Philip Morris's Marlboro, had grown by seven percent a year over a three-year period, and they continued to gain market share almost everywhere in Europe. A spokesman for Philip Morris said in 1992 that the group planned a $3 billion overseas investment program over the next five years. In 1993 Philip Morris's profits from international business were up 19 percent to $2 billion. British American Tobacco's exports rose from 45 billion cigarettes in 1989 to 129 billion in 1992. RJR Nabisco's international tobacco profits rose by 13 percent to $17 million in the first quarter of 1994. In new markets, Philip Morris bought an existing tobacco company in east Germany, gaining 44 percent of the market there in 1992. Reynolds also bought a factory in Germany, and British American Tobacco gained 11 percent of the market there. Philip Morris expected to start producing Marlboros in Russia in 1993. R.J. Reynolds planned to produce Camels and other brands in a joint venture in Kazakhstan by late 1992. In the early 90s, multinationals competed to set up operations in Hungary, Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. Far East markets were already a prime source of profits. Rothmans had 55 percent of the Malasian market. Philip Morris captured 11 percent of the Japanese market in the mid-1980s. BAT, too, was well established in the Far East through Lucky Strike and Kent.", "Cigarette consumption has declined in the US because of health concerns and government regulations. At the same time, demand for cigarettes has increased worldwide. The market for cigarettes in former eastern block countries alone exceeds the declining US market. Since the early 1990's, American tobacco companies, including Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco, have sought ways to satisfy the increased demand for cigarettes in new markets in Asia and the Pacific Rim and in Eastern Europe, especially for US brands as Marlboros. Phillip Morris has expanded its plant in North Carolina to increase capacity by 50 percent; has stakes in plants in Russia, East Germany, Kazakstan, Lithuania, and the Czech Republic; is building a plant in Russia, near St. Petersburg; acquired a plant in Hungary; signed an agreement with China to produce Marlboro cigarettes; and developed a program to improve the quality and quantity of Kazakhstan's tobacco crop. RJR Nabisco has stakes in plants near St. Petersburg and in Hungary; and is building plants in Turkey, Poland, and the Czech Republic. International brands as Marlboro continued to gain market share almost everywhere. However, opposition to cigarette advertisements has been growing in Europe, and several countries, including France, Italy, Germany, Spain, the UK, have banned or severely restricted advertisements. Cigarette makers and continued to advertise in less developed countries. Worldwide sales have continued to grow. Phillip Morris in 1994 reported a 19 percent volume increase, with gains in France, Italy, Germany, Spain, central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Japan, and Korea.", "American cigarette manufacturing companies faced with declining sales because of health concerns regarding cigarettes and restrictions on advertising began to diversify and acquire companies that produce non-tobacco products. These same companies realized that a lucrative market for tobacco products existed overseas, especially in the countries of the former Soviet Union and those in the Soviet bloc. So, American tobacco companies began to increase marketing overseas and invest in foreign cigarette or initiate cigarette production in foreign countries. Philip Morris with its world leading Marlboro brand increased sales in France, Italy and Spain. The company plans to begin producing Marlboros in Russia. In conjunction with the Austrian state tobacco monopoly jointly bought a company near Budapest that had been making Marlboros under license. That factory would send cigarettes to Ukraine. Philip Morris signed an co-operation agreement with China, the world's biggest market, to produce Marlboros. Philip Morris also bought a factory in Czechoslovakia. The company also gained control of a Kazakhstan cigarette manufacturing operation. RJR Nabisco added volume in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. The company started work on a cigarette factory near Warsaw. They have plants in Russia and Ukraine. They plan to build a factory in Turkey to produce cigarettes. RJR plans to produce Camels and other brands in Kazakhstan. Foreign tobacco operations for major US tobacco firms kept the companies profitable despite lagging domestic cigarette sales.", "Two U.S. tobacco companies, Phillip Morris and RJ Reynolds, used aggressive, long-term strategies, beyond export sales, to capture new international tobacco markets which privatization had expanded from 60% closed to 95% open. Their parent companies, PM and RJR Nabisco, both fared well from outstanding quarterly profit increases from their international tobacco operations, more than from their other divisions. In the U.S. PM lowered Marlboro cigarette prices to increase U.S. market share, and bolster Marlboro's image for global marketing; and increased U.S. production by 50% for overseas sales. RJR and PM each built, bought or acquired equity in factories in Russia, East Germany, Hungary and Poland. RJR bought factories in Turkey and acquired equity in the Ukraine and Kazakhstan. PM acquired equity in Czechoslovakia. In Lithuania PM bought a monopoly tobacco company protected by high import duties, which gave PM contacts into Estonia, Latvia, Belarus, and Russia. It was the biggest initial western investment in the Baltic States. In Russia PM undercut prices of Russian businesses, and accepted barter payment for PM's first major import of cigarettes to quell \"tobacco riots\". In Kazakhstan RJR spent $200m over 5 years to modernize a factory, and spent $25m to improve quality and quantity of Kazakhstan's tobacco crop. In East Germany PM improved its existing brands and added Marlboro production. In Hungary PM increased cigarette exports to Ukraine. In China RJR established a joint venture. PM established a joint venture with the state tobacco company. In Poland PM offered $200m to modernize a factory.", "Two major U.S. cigarette producers, Philip Morris (PM) and R J Reynolds (RJR) moved in the early 1990's to expand exports to compensate for dwindling domestic profits. The principal targets were the former communist eastern bloc countries, the Middle East, and the Far East. Both companies soon moved to buy or build cigarette factories abroad. Both gained production facilities in Russia, Poland, Hungary and Turkey while RJR entered the Czech Republic and PM bought into Lithuania. PM gained control of Kazakhstan's Almaty Tobacco Kombinat. Hungary was viewed as a gate to the Ukraine market while Lithuania and Kazakhstan were seen as future exporters. Both companies were successful. By 1994 PM and RJR were shipping more than 10 billion cigarettes a year to the former Soviet Union. In the Far East by 1993 PM had secured 12% of the Japanese market. The number of cigarettes shipped by the two companies to the Pacific Rim increased from 18 billion in 1985 to 87 billion in 1992. Each quarter showed increased volumes and profits in the international tobacco market. In the first quarter of 1994 RJR volumes rose by 12% and operating profits by 13%. By the third quarter of 1994 PM reported volumes up 19% to 144 billion and profits up 18%. Within PM it was seen as a victory for the \"smoking faction\" of the company against those who had suggested splitting off the tobacco side of the company.", "As smoking lost acceptance in the United States, US cigarette producers fought to survive. They formed or joined multi-national conglomerates and pursued international tobacco markets as communism fell and monopolies were relaxed. Competition also was heavy in Western Europe, where anti-smoking policies and laws were just beginning. Phillip Morris (with Marlboros) wooed Russian by supplying 20billion cigarettes after the 1990 tobacco riots and began planning and building factories and entering into joint ventures as the industry was privatized. It also moved into former Soviet states, building a factory in Lithuania and acquiring controlling of a Kazakhstan factory. Phillip Morris also brokered deals in Eastern Europe including Hungary (aiming to export to the Ukraine), Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Poland and eastern Germany. Asian markets, especially Japan, Taiwan and China, were also pursued. Phillip Morris' success was revealed by its increase in exports (24.4% in 1990), overseas sales gains (24% in 2d quarter 1991), and rising international tobacco profits (19.9% in 1992). In 1993, Phillip Morris had 12% of the 320 billion-cigarette market in Japan. RJR(eynolds) Nabisco also diversified and invested overseas. It built factories in Turkey and Poland, bought factories in Germany and Hungary (also aiming at exports to the Ukraine), and entered joint ventures in Kazakhstan and China. Nabisco's net sales in Europe, Asia and the mid-East increased by 19% in 1991; international tobacco sales rose by $20million in 1992, and international tobacco sales were up by 12% in 1993. In 1991 it sold 14 billion cigarettes in Russia.", "America's tobacco companies -- namely, Phillip Morris (PM), R. J. Reynolds (RJR), BAT Industries, and Rothman's International -- have taken a more aggressive approach to selling cigarettes. This effort is in reaction to a domestic outbreak of hostility from politicians, government officials, business, and the public in efforts to curb tobacco consumption by stringent anti-smoking measures. The tobacco industry initially has responded with intense advertising, lobbying in Washington, and using cash flow from tobacco operations to finance diversification into food industries. Phillip Morris, e.g., acquired Kraft, Inc. and Miller brewing Company. However, their sales assault overseas; namely, the Far East, has provided a burgeoning increase in profits. From 1990 to 1994, Phillip Morris made successful investments into private and state-owned businesses in Switzerland, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan. Lithuania, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Japan and China. RJR made profitable investments in Turkey, Hungary, Poland, Russia, Canada, and Western Europe. BAT Industries' cigarettes dominate the market in Japan and Taiwan while Rothman's International strengthened its tobacco interest in Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The opening of new markets abroad is due to the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, China's new open-market policy, the breaking of cigarette monopolies in Western Europe, and an increase in smoking habits in Asia. Despite continuing anti-smoking pressures from domestic private and public sources and a loss of profits in a price war in 1993, US tobacco companies appear capable of sustaining strong momentum. PM said it sold 201 billion cigarettes worldwide during the third quarter of 1994.", "To expand markets abroad in the early 1990s, American tobacco companies took advantage of weak advertising restrictions, trade barrier removal, and state tobacco monopoly liberalization, in China, Soviet Union, Japan, Eastern Europe, South Korea, France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Thailand, Taiwan, and Portugal. US/multinational companies partnered with foreign cigarette manufacturers and distributors. They bought into or built factories to produce both western and local brands. International sales and company profits increased steadily. Philip Morris advertised intensely and invested heavily to increase production and crops worldwide. After exporting cigarettes to Russia to satisfy 1990 shortages, PM acquired three Russian factories. It also acquired production interests in Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, and China, and expanded its NC plant. PM made market gains in Russia, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Japan, Taiwan, Argentina and Brazil. It cut US prices to restore Marlboro's US standing. PM often entered markets with both cigarettes and food. Overseas, Marlboro outsold other western brands two to one. RJR Nabisco acquired factory interests in Hungary, Kazakhstan, Poland, Russia, Turkey, the Ukraine, and China. BAT's US brands sell well in Japan, Hungary, and France. Slower at globalization, BAT acquired production interests in the Ukraine, Hungary and Russia. Obstacles to overseas expansion included health-conscious Western Europeans' declining consumption, France's tobacco advertising ban, undeveloped infrastructures in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet bloc, Far Eastern red tape and anti-imports sentiment, South Korean national monopoly domination, China's import restriction to hard currency outlets, and accusations of exploiting ignorance in less developed countries.", "Although the domestic market for cigarettes in America in the l990s was greatly reduced due to bans on advertising, smoking in public places, and health warnings, American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food. Sales of cigarettes to Western Europe continued to do modestly well in spite of competition from European companies. At the same time East European and Asian markets opened up with the fall of the Soviet Union and the lifting of trade restrictions. Two American companies moved quickly into these markets, RJ Reynolds and particularly, Philip Morris. Philip Morris used a strategy of buying large shares of existing cigarette manufacturing facilities in Eastern Europe and opening new plants. Philip Morris set up operations in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, near St. Petersburg, Russia, Krakow, Poland, and Turkey. In each case, Philip Morris negotiated to primarily manufacture it's popular Marlboro brand along wit local brands. In Asia, Philip Morris opened a plant in Kazakhstan with an eye to opening in Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Thailand, and particularly China, the biggest world market, as trade restrictions are lifted. Argentina and Brazil are also major markets. Overall, volume of production of cigarettes rose during the time of reduced consumption in the US. In October 1994, Philip Morris claimed to have sold 201 billion cigarettes, an increase of 18% over previous sales. Most quarters showed earning gains, in spite of a $.40 price drop to American consumers per pack of Marlboros."]}

Include any arguments used for or against such laws.", "summaries": ["In the late 1990's some governments were moving toward banning smoking in smokers' last havens--restaurants and bars, while other nations had yet to ban smoking in hospitals. Acknowledged health hazards were the primary reason to ban smoking, including the cost of health care. Reasons not to support laws included that they violated individual and free-trade rights, governments lost revenues from tobacco sales, bars and restaurants would lose business, and bans did not decrease smoking or stop teens from starting. Non-compliance and non-enforcement were rampant. In the United States, earlier workplace bans were expanding to include bars and restaurants in California, New York, and New Jersey. The same expansion was occurring in Canada and Australia. In Latin America, smoking generally was banned in hospitals, theaters, and transportation facilities. In Europe, bans ranged from none in Portugal to every public place but pubs in England. Israel was on par with the United States, but other mid-East countries either had no laws--especially tobacco growing countries, or did not enforce them. South Africa enacted tough laws in 1998, with no smoking in public areas outside designated smoking zones. In 1996 Chinese provincial and local governments began enacting bans on smoking in public places, but they were generally ignored. Macao and Thailand banned smoking in some public places. Japan had few laws even protecting public transportation. Singapore had been enacted increasingly restrictive laws since 1970. By 1998, smoking was allowed only in selected bars and outdoors; 18% of the people still smoked.", "Laws banning smoking in public places or the workplace were considered and in most cases passed by a wide variety of governments during the 1990's. In 1989 China's first such law was adopted in Changzhi of north China's Shanxi Province in recognition of smoking and second-hand smoke as a serious public health problem. Beijing followed suit in 1996 and by 1998 79 provinces and cities in China had public smoking bans. Similar laws were passed in Macao, Iran, South Africa, Thailand, Jordan, Singapore, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Turkey and Canada. Enforcement was notably strict in Singapore and quite lax in Belgium and Jordan. France banned smoking in public transport, public buildings and hospitals in 1991, but enforcement of the ban in the workplace was left to the boss. In the United Kingdom strict enforcement left the pub as the smoker's only refuge in 1997. New York City introduced a smoking ban in restaurants in 1995 despite arguments from restaurateurs that it would harm business. Subsequent surveys disagreed as to whether the restaurants had suffered. In 2000 the Governor of New Jersey vetoed a bill that would have fined underage smokers for possession of cigarettes in public places. Opposition groups argued that the measure would not be effective in cutting down the number of teenaged smokers. While the public health benefits of such laws were undeniable, opponents in South Africa argued unconstitutionality and an infringement on individual and free-trade rights.", "In China, a total of 70 provinces and cities banned smoking in public places to improve health and lessen the impact of second-hand smoke on children. In the U.S., California banned smoking in bars and nightclubs. A smokers' rights group called for the law's repeal. Trenton, N.J. rejected an anti-smoking ordinance because it was too broad and focused on teens. New York City bans smoking in restaurants. Canada prohibits smoking in public places like government buildings and auditoriums, and in some areas in bars and restaurants. Toronto abandoned efforts to ban smoking in bars and restaurants because of widespread opposition. South Africa's tough law bans smoking in public and work places, with exemptions for ventilated smoking areas. The country's tobacco industry challenged the law's constitutionality. Italy prohibits smoking in public and private indoor areas, except in ventilated smoking zones, to combat its high lung cancer death rate. Macao extended its non-smoking law to include all health care facilities, children's areas, public transportation, and other facilities to combat its increased number of smokers. Singapore has strict anti-smoking laws. The U.K., Belgium, Denmark, France, Israel, Iran, and Australia all prohibit smoking in public places. Smoking restrictions in Turkey, Jordan, Brazil, and Greece are largely ignored. Mexico, Spain, and Russia prohibit smoking in some public areas and public transport. Thailand announced it will start enforcing its Non-smokers' Health Protection Act, which bans smoking in public places. Germany rejected a tough anti-smoking bill which would have covered public places, buses, and workplaces.", "Increasingly, the nations of the world are enacting laws to ban or restrict smoking in certain areas, mostly in public places such as hospitals, schools, stores, and transportations systems. Many of the laws allow exceptions for well-ventilated areas of bars and cafes. In some countries, especially in Western Europe anti-smoking laws have been enacted but are not enforced and are mostly ignored. Some countries, such as Germany have voted down proposed anti-smoking legislation. Singapore has legislation that would make the entire country non-smoking. In China, anti-smoking bans have been decreed in the major cities but have not been followed in towns in lesser-populated areas. In the US, the GOP-dominated Senate voted down sweeping anti-smoking legislation but encouraged states to punish minors who smoke. The New Jersey governor vetoed a bill that would have punished underage smokers but several towns in that state have enacted smoking bans. Within the US, California has the strictest anti-smoking rules. Opposition to anti-smoking bans is mostly from restaurant and bar owners who claim they will lose business if smoking is not allowed. However, not all restaurant owners share that view. Anti-smoking opponents in South Africa may attempt to challenge smoking bans on constitutional grounds. Anti-smoking elements in Jordan claim that economic and health costs far outweigh revenues from domestic tobacco production and imports."]}

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) banned trade in rhino horns (1976) and ivory (1989). Kenya established well-policed protected areas to control poaching in 1993 after Zimbabwe, in 1992, began shooting rhinos with sleep-inducing darts, removing their horns, and releasing them, thus removing poachers' incentive to kill the animals. Zambia introduced licensed hunting with proceeds distributed to villagers to gain their cooperation. Nine African nations joined to fight trading in ivory and rhino horns in 1994 while the U.S. embargoed imports of wildlife products from CITES violators China and Taiwan. Establishment of wildlife reserves protected tigers in India, bison in Poland, monkeys in Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, koalas and platypuses in Australia, polecats in Wales, pine martens in Scotland, wild dogs in South Africa, manatees in Ivory Coast, lemurs in Madagascar, several unique species in Tibet, bears in the Pyrenees and pandas in China. International restrictions on fishing and whaling have made some progress but sea turtles and some whales are still endangered. Another approach is captive breeding in which zoos or laboratories breed captive endangered species then reintroduce the progeny to suitable natural habitat. This has assisted in preservation of cranes in North America, Asia and Australia, barn owls in England, ferrets in Wyoming, and tigers in Indonesia. Unfortunately Thailand and other countries fail to enforce the rules of CITES forbidding trade in endangered species.", "Wildlife in danger of extinction includes species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. Threatened mammals include golden lion tamarins in Brazil; African elephants poached for their ivory tusks; black and white rhinos hunted for their horns; Indian tigers hunted to meet the demand for tiger bone; jaguars and black Howler monkeys in Belize; blue and humpback whales; Arabian Oryxes; black-footed ferrets; tigers in Sumatra; bison in Poland; wild dogs in southern Africa; African manatees; giant Pandas; lemurs in Madagascar; harp and hooded seals; bears in the Pyrenees; and orangutans in Indonesia. Threatened birds include red kites, British barn owls, and North American whooping cranes; threatened reptiles include sea turtles in waters from the Caribbean to the Atlantic and from the Mediterranean to the Pacific; and threatened amphibians include South American caimans and Majorcan toads. Programs seeking to protect wildlife from extinction can be grouped together according to the nature of the methods they use. One group of programs is concerned with banning or restricting activities, such as trading in ivory, poaching of rhinos, commercial whaling, hunting turtles, and importing baby sealskins; and with punishing those engaged in such activities, such as embargoing imports from countries failing to stem trade in rhino and tiger parts. Another group of programs is concerned with establishing conservation areas, such as the preserve in Belize for jaguars and monkeys and the whale sanctuary around Antarctica where hunting is prohibited. Another group deals with breeding endangered species, such as whooping cranes and tamarins, in captivity.", "There are animals of all species in most parts of the world that are in danger of extinction. The chief reasons seem to be loss of habitat and hunting by indigenous populations for food and the hunting by poachers for profit to sell animal parts. The 400 different species of wildlife on Madagascar are severely threatened due to the slash and burn method of agriculture used on the island. Most of these animals are found nowhere else on earth. Animals as large as the African elephant and as small as partula snails are threatened. Other animals that are endangered include sea turtles, jaguars, pandas, tigers, black rhinos, barn owls, lemurs, caimans, and orangutans. Environmental groups and government agencies have established laws to protect endangered species, but such laws are difficult to enforce, especially in third world countries where pouching is common and wildlife often can destroy the crops of small farmers. Game parks and wildlife preserves help save some endangered species. Some groups have developed very creative approaches to increasing populations of certain species. For example, tamarin monkeys have been bred in zoos in the United States and then released back to their native habitat in Brazil. Aviculturists who go to extreme lengths in breeding the birds and then feeding the babies have saved cranes. In Africa conservation programs have been coupled with programs that provide jobs to native peoples through limited hunting and tourism. The idea is to provide an economic incentive to protect the animals.", "A wide variety of animals are in endangered around the world. Among them are large mammals such as elephants and rhinoceroses, big cats such as tigers and snow leopards, and smaller animals such as black-footed ferrets and indri lemurs. Endangered primates include orangutans, gorillas, and monkeys. Among the many endangered birds are whooping cranes and barn owls. Reptiles such as snakes, toads, and caimans are in trouble, as are many ocean creatures including whales, manatees, sea turtles, and seals. Numerous programs have been created to protect these endangered species. Many programs breed animals in captivity and release them into their native habitats. Other programs create nature and wildlife reserves which not only protect the species, but their habitats as well. Strict enforcement of the 1973 Convention on Trade in Endangered Species does much to preserve animal populations. Bans on trade in ivory, rhino horns, and tiger parts help those species. Zimbabwe has a rhino dehorning program, making poaching unprofitable. Zambia limits hunting by auctioning hunting rights to safari companies. Financial incentives to encourage the protection of a species have been used successfully in African countries. To protect whales, commercial whaling has been banned. The US Congress ordered shrimpers use \"turtle excluder devices\" in their trawling nets to protect sea turtles. Europe has imposed a permanent ban on baby sealskin imports. Tibetan scientists discovered a way to speed up bamboo flowering to increase the panda's food sources, while China uses its \"rent-a-panda\" program to get money for panda conservation."]}

Include different types of compost, their uses, origins and benefits.", "summaries": ["Composts hold water and keep soil aerated; some provide nutrients. Pure sphagnum moss peat composts from Ireland, England, U.S. and elsewhere are best for seeding and potting. They are clean, light, easy to handle, highly absorbent, moderately acid, porous, and sterile. They provide very little plant food, so plant-specific nutrients can be added. Original British \"John Innes\" style soil-based composts consist primarily of sphagnum moss peat and high quality loam. Low quality brands contain too little humus and become impervious to air and water. Multi-purpose non-soil peat composts were developed as high quality loam became scarce. Some contain chemicals and wetting agents. Multi-purpose non-peat composts were developed as high-quality peat became scarce, initially using non-toxic softwood bark from timber waste. Many commercial composts use recycled materials. Dehydrated and limed sewer sludge is mixed and oxidized with bark sawdust, as well as organic household waste and plant waste. Some commercial composts add chemical nitrogen or animal waste. Home gardening composts can be any garden (leaves, grass) or kitchen refuse (fruits, vegetables, husks, egg shells, coffee grounds, canning waste, not meat), on top of twigs or chopped corn stalks to aid aeration and drainage. Top with grass clippings or manure (20%). Keep moist and stir monthly to aerate. Cover loosely to retain heat. In apartments use a plastic bag, but aerate frequently. Composting kits add helpful organic compounds. Compost can also be used as top-cover mulch to hold in moisture. Fungus composted wood chips are used to decontaminate organic compounds from soil.", "In composting, bacteria and fungi turn organic refuse into a moist black soil conditioner. Composting reduces waste. Some compost removes toxic soil residue. Compost mulch protects from frost, controls weeds, and keeps soil moist. Traditional topsoil, leafmold, and sand composts were lumpy, impervious, and too-finely textured. Use declined with loam shortages and peat-based compost popularity. Peat is absorbent, porous, light, clean, and convenient, but peat bogs shelter rare species and need to be conserved. Substitutes include plant waste, ground-up Christmas trees, coconut fiber, softwood bark, and shredded newspaper. Mushroom-growing composts may contain horse manure, straw, millet, grape residue, chicken waste, and cottonseed meal. They are sold to gardeners after harvest. Pine needle or redwood sawdust (containing natural fungicides) is mixed with sand, perlite or soil for growing bulbs. In a home compost frame of 2-by-4s and chicken wire, pile vegetarian kitchen refuse (fruit and vegetable waste, coffee grounds, egg shells) over a base of twigs or chopped corn stalks. Add nitrogen-rich material (manure, grass clippings, hay, green weeds, fertilizer, aluminum sulfate), coarser material for aeration, and turn occasionally, wetting when dry. Cover to retain heat. Or, partially fill a black plastic bag with kitchen and plant refuse, add a nitrogen product and water. Set in sunlight, poke drainage holes, and kick occasionally. Communities have composted commercial fruit and vegetable processor waste or horse manure with grass, shredded leaves, and tree trimmings. Sewage sludge has been mixed in computer-controlled processes with bark, sawdust, leaves, and household waste to become agricultural compost.", "British gardeners began by using a combination of topsoil, leaf mold and sand for a growing medium. This was generally replaced by sphagnum peat moss extracted from bogs. It was absorbent, porous and virtually sterile. Because of the depletion of the bogs, it fell from favor and peat-free composts were devised using softwood bark, plant waste or coconut fiber. These were pleasant to handle and moist and crumbly. Backyard composting became very popular. A free fertilizer is created from non-meat kitchen waste and garden waste, moistened and aerated until it decays. Cities began composting yard waste to save landfill space. Christmas trees are composted from California to Number 10 Downing Street. Horse manure, which degrades in only 4 weeks, is a good addition to this compost, as is shredded newspaper. Cities are trying mixing treated sewer sludge with leaves, sawdust, or bark to create a relatively odorless compost. Mushrooms are grown in compost made of horse manure with millet added and covered with peat, or a combination of grape residue, chicken waste, cottonseed meal, and straw. Calochortus grow best in a combination of sand, perlite, and pine needles or of topsoil, sand, and sawdust. Cover dahlia tubers with soil and peat or compost. Vegetables need yard compost with chicken manure and fish emulsion added. Amend soil for flowers with redwood compost, KRA organic amendment, or Bandini soil builder. One special compost combines wood chips and fungi to breakdown toxic organic compounds. Another adds nematodes to kill harmful insect larva.", "Good gardening compost is commonly made from a variety of sources: vegetable and fruit waste, plant waste, tree bark, grass clippings, peat, chicken waste and horse manure. Peat has the longest history of use as garden compost but ecological concerns about exhausting peat sources have led to development of other material. Many prefer good topsoil from the garden or vermiculite and perlite. Special seed compost can be purchased in bags but it often becomes lumpy when watered. Research has led to development of special peat-free composts for either potting seed, seed germination, or for growing-on mature plants. Now there is a single mixture for all purposes in the home garden. There is also a peat-free product made from softwood bark which has no toxic or other elements harmful to the garden. Composted horse manure, which takes about 19 days to degrade, has only 3% salt and is usually mixed with five parts grass and leaves. A growing concern about the recycling ethic and water conservation has led to an increase in backyard composting. It allows the gardener to keep a steady supply of compost for use around the yard. It can be made from green waste, leaves, and fruit and vegetable waste, kept in a homemade wire or screen cage, and covered with newspaper or plastic to retain heat. It is turned and mixed every few months until it decays. The city-dump-is-going-to-overflow crisis is aided by the use of sewer sludge mixed with sawdust and the composting of Christmas trees."]}

Negotiations were expected to be amiable since most issues had been worked out between General Motors and the union the previous year following a major strike. About 9000 parts plant workers went on strike, shutting down several factories. GM was vulnerable to parts plant closings due to its reliance on delivering parts just before production time. The union wanted job security and improved health and safety conditions. Workers had become alarmed over the years with outsourcing of parts manufacturing jobs to Mexico. They accused GM Corporation of spending billions of dollars in developing countries while failing to invest in aging American factories. Tentative agreements were reached in July '98 and assembly plants reopened. Key issues for the new contract included job security, health, and assignment of work to outside suppliers. The union worried about the opening of nonunion plants, such as one planned in Alabama by DaimlerChrysler. The automakers were concerned with keeping costs down to remain competitive with foreign carmakers. The UAW threatened to break their relations with Ford Motor Company and to strike when Ford announced intentions to use outside parts supplier, Visteon. Both parties wanted to avoid slow down of the production line during the year of record sales. All three companies negotiated contracts that gave raises, signing bonuses, and improvements in pensions and cost-of-living adjustments. The Big Three, in return, won freedom to reduce costs through reduction in workforce.", "The key issues between the United Auto Workers (UAW) and the three largest automakers - General Motors (GM), Ford Motor Company, and Daimler Chrysler - have traditionally focused on demands for job security, health care costs, overtime pay, compensation, investments, and downsizing. When the UAW feels these demands are utmost, they generally respond by workers' strikes. The automobile executives, especially at GM, have vowed to proceed with a long-standing plan to keep costs down, invest heavily in new models and technology, simplify building and selling of vehicles, and to cope with non-U.S. competitors. This plan concerns the UAW because it is causing a decline in high payday assembly jobs as industry becomes more efficient and needs fewer workers. The most contentious labor issue is outsourcing, which at GM and Ford involves \"spinning off\" auto parts divisions, the purchasing of pre-assembled module parts from outside suppliers, investment in assembly plants overseas, while not investing in aging American factories. A strike in 1998 over the downgrading of two parts factories in Flint, Michigan shut down GM's North American production at a loss of $2 billion in revenue. With record sales and profits now at all three automakers, both sides are eager to avoid strikes. This enabled the UAW to craft contracts with the automakers providing workers with 3% raises each year for four years, a signing bonus of $1,350, and improvements in pensions and cost-of-living adjustments. The issue of \"spin-off\" could become contentious if it leads to shedding workers or lowering pay.", "In negotiating labor agreements between the major US automobile manufacturers and the United Auto Workers, the principal issue on the part of the UAW is job security. The automakers seek labor contracts that would allow them to increase productivity that, they say, is hampered by union work rules and union opposition to outsourcing. General Motors and Ford would both like to spin off their parts divisions, Delphi and Visteon, respectively, into separate companies which would have different labor agreements. The UAW contends that GM has reneged on a pledge to modernize and has ignored health and safety grievances. The UAW says that GM is spending billions of dollars on factories in developing countries and failing to invest at home. GM counters that the majority of its investments are in the US but for car-building operations only and not for its parts division. GM contends that the quota system in effect at Delphi results in employees being paid for eight hours work when often a worker accomplishes the task in four to six hours. The future of parts workers remains a key issue at both GM and Ford. Replacement of retiring workers is also an issue for DaimlerChrylser as well as at GM and Ford. Wages and benefits continue to be an issue between the UAW and the big three automakers.", "United Auto Worker demands during 1998 strikes at GM's Flint Michigan metal stamping plant and Delphi parts plant were that GM stop outsourcing, stop selling GM Delphi plants, return to the U.S. all Delphi plants in Mexico, and improve worker health and safety. The UAW insisted that GM invest $180 million in Flint plants. Strike-idled workers should get two-weeks vacation. Safety grievances were about hazardous materials, noise, and old equipment. GM wanted no strike threats and increased productivity. In 1999 national contract negotiations with GM, Ford, and Daimler/Chrysler the UAW demands were wages, job security, health care, overtime, and outsourcing. The UAW got 3% annual raises, a $1,350 contract signing bonus, better coast-of-living adjustments, and improved retiree benefits. The UAW demanded that Daimler/Chrysler keep jobs at current levels, not impede union organizing, and improve pensions. Daimler/Chrysler agreed to not sell-off its U.S. operations. The UAW asked GM that GM invest in American plants instead of overseas, and no outsourcing. The UAW wanted divested Delphi workers covered under the GM contract, allowed to transfer back to GM, and retire with GM pensions. The UAW wanted GM to stop reorganizing plants for fewer workers. UAW wanted a seat on the GM Board of Directors. GM proposed a lifetime employment guarantee for workers with more than 10 years seniority. GM could reduce the workforce by attrition at agreed rates and operate more plants 24.7. UAW did not want Ford to sell-off its Visteon parts division, unless the workers remained Ford employees."]}

What has been his reaction to the IRA acts of violence?", "summaries": ["British Prime Minister John Majors reacted strongly to late October 1993 violence by the Irish Republican Army (IRA). He said he would do no deals with people who plant bombs and kill innocent people and the perpetrators would be hunted down. At that time he distanced himself from the Hume-Adams peace proposals and underlined the gulf between the sides, expressing interest in three-strand talks. He did say he would discuss positive proposals and was willing to meet with principals. While working with Irish Prime Minister John Reynolds, Majors condemned tit-for-tat killings by terrorists from both Catholic and Protestant communities. He reaffirmed his determination to restart the negotiating process designed to bring a permanent political settlement to Ulster. He also ruled out secret agreements and was wary of false optimism. He made it clear that any Anglo-Irish declarations would have to balance guarantees to Northern Ireland Unionists and recognize aspirations of Ulster Nationalists. He appealed to Unionists to accept the peace initiative and said, \"I support the Union\". He also said he would not allow violence to derail peace talks and would let the political wing of the IRA into negotiations only when violence was renounced for good. He scornfully rejected the IRA's 72-hour post-Easter 1994 ceasefire. In August he said there would be no concessions to anyone. He doubted the permanency of the September IRA ceasefire but by November was involved with planning the dismantling of paramilitary arsenals.", "The British PM, John Major, was deeply engaged in meetings with Irish PM Albert Reynolds to speed up negotiations between the IRA and Northern Ireland to come to a peace agreement. The negotiations have been stymied by continuous acts of violence within Northern Ireland as well as Great Britain's mainland. Mr. Major says that all sides would have to make uncomfortable compromises. Both PMs issued a set of guiding principles for the negotiations that essentially specify the conditions by which Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, would be accepted into the peace process. Namely, the principles call for a permanent end to violent activity and a commitment by Sinn Fein to the process of peaceful and democratic means only. Mr. Major also declared that he was ready to table his own comprehensive proposals for devolved government in Ulster and a redefinition of the relationships between Britain and the Republic of Ireland. He stated that he supported the union of Great Britain and Ireland but did not want to impose his view on the greater number of people of Northern Ireland if they decide otherwise. The PM says he is optimistic about the chance for peace but has fiercely denounced the persistent terrorist acts of bombings and killings. In one speech, he said he wanted one message from the IRA: \"We have given up violence for good\". He condemned the tit-for-tat killings and appealed to the people of Northern Ireland to show no tolerance toward the gunmen and bombers.", "Violence often interrupted or delayed peace talks in Northern Ireland in 1993 and 1994. In January, 1993, Irish republican leaders made overtures to the British government about ending the violence. After an explosion at gasworks in Warrington in February, a spokesman said the British government's reply would be influenced by events on the ground, adding that, \"It is not possible to give a substantive reply immediately.\" On March 7, an IRA bomb injured four policemen in Bangor. The British Message: \"In light of the continued violence of recent days...we are not yet able to send a substantive response.\" In May, a 1,000-pound bomb exploded in Belfast, injuring 20. A British official wrote that it was absolutely clear from the attacks which took place in March and May that events on the ground could halt progress. In the wake of the killing of 10 people in October, 1993, on Belfast's Shankill Road, a Protestant area, the Hume-Adams initiative appeared doomed. An important meeting of the Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference was postponed. Ulster Unionists demanded an end to the initiative. In early November, 1993, after the murder of seven people by the Loyalists, the peace initiative launched by the British and Irish governments was rejected by the leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party. In November, 1994, the murder of a post office worker in Newry, and Sinn Fein's less than frank explanation, underscored British concerns that the issue of arms and explosives must be addressed before full political negotiations could begin.", "From 1993 to 1994, British Prime Minister John Major even-handedly condemned violence by all sides in Northern Ireland. Major berated \"butchery in which members of both communities were mown down\" -- \"murderous and premeditated acts which could serve no end other than to deepen the bloodshed in Northern Ireland\". \"I appeal to all the people of Northern Ireland to show no tolerance to the gunmen and the bombers,\" being \"hunted down and subjected to the full severity of the law\". Major and the Irish Prime Minister promised to bring Ulster into negotiations -- and Sinn Fein, if \"a renunciation of violence had been made and sufficiently demonstrated\". \"I am not going to do deals with people who plant bombs and kill innocent people\". \"If Mr. Adams can end the violence then he should end the violence now without preconditions, without delay... and without any proposals which sound to me tantamount to blackmail\" ... \"no talks or negotiations between democratic governments and those who use, threaten or support violence\". The Republic must replace constitutional claims to Ulster with aspirations for uniting Ireland. Major's top priority is to devolve Ulster government and redefine relationships between Britain and the Republic and between north and south. Major denied making deals with Ulster Unionists or the Democratic Unionist Party. \"I shall not seek to impose my view on the greater number of people of Northern Ireland if they decide otherwise\". Major acknowledged that moving IRA prisoners to Northern Ireland undermined unionist confidence ."]}
{"id": "D0644H", "query": "What factors led to the federal budget surplus? What are the expectations for future surpluses? What have been proposed for use of the surplus?", "summaries": ["1998's federal budget surplus resulted from a combination of strong growth, low inflation, declining unemployment, and improving efficiency. Much came from excess Social Security payroll taxes. Other enabling factors included Treasury and Federal Reserve cooperation on spending restraint that kept interest rates low, Wall Street booming, and Americans increasingly prosperous; and a 1997 agreement by the White House and congress to balance the budget. The White House predicted surpluses over the next 15 years. The less optimistic said projections for more than five years were difficult. President Clinton favored using most of the surplus for Social Security. He also wanted to fix Medicare's financial problems and expand it to include prescription drug coverage, create new IRAs with investment options, and spend on military and other critical needs. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan favored strengthening Social Security and paying off the federal debt. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin urged interest rate cuts and IMF contributions. Democrats and Republicans both favored using most of the surplus for Social Security. Republicans wanted income tax cuts in everything except Social Security, and an increase in allowed IRA contributions. They supported self-employed health insurance deductions and increases for Medicare, veterans' health benefits, and schools. Democrats favored tax credits for family caregivers. Presidential candidate Al Gore favored spending increases while George Bush favored tax cuts and smaller spending increases. Both supported stashing the surplus from Social Security in a lock box to pay down the debt.", "The United States had a budget surplus of a total of $423 billion for the three years of 1998, 1999, and 2000. This surplus was created by a combination of a balanced budget package and an exceptional economy. Strong growth, low inflation, a strong job market, increased productivity, and increased consumer spending characterized the economy. In the year 2000, expectations were high for future budget surpluses. The White House forecast a surplus of $4 to $4.4 trillion over the next 15 years. Congress was predicting a surplus of $2.6 to $2.9 trillion over the next 10 years. There was a large disparity between the Democrats and Republicans on what to do with this surplus. The Democrats wanted to spend the money and have only limited tax cuts. They wanted to shore up social security and Medicare and reduce the Federal debt with a goal of no debt by 2012. They wanted to spend money on job training, education, defense--including a pay raise for military personnel, medical research, improved health care, school construction, and assistance to the unemployed and those with low incomes. The Republicans considered the surplus an overpayment by American taxpayers and primarily sought to cut taxes, targeting $800 billion in cuts over the next 10 years. They did agree on more spending for social security, instituting a prescription drug benefit for Medicare, and some reduction of the Federal debt with a target of no debt by 2016.", "The US Federal budget surpluses achieved in the late 1990s were the result of fiscal discipline imposed after the huge deficits of the previous decade. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is credited with strong fiscal management and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan kept interest rates low. A strong job market, low inflation and high productivity were factors boosting the surplus. Wall Street was booming and investors were getting richer and increasing the tax base. It appeared to many economists that an era of budget surpluses was at hand and surpluses could be expected 15 years ahead. The Congressional Budget Office in 1995 had projected deficits ten years ahead but by 1998 was predicting a $100 billion surplus for 2005. But they had projected $100-200 billion deficit for 1997 that turned into a $100-200 billion surplus thus casting doubt on its forecasting ability. The existence of a surplus naturally had politicians proposing ways to spend it. The Clinton Administration called for Social Security and Medicaid funding, retirement saving accounts and military readiness. Many liberals wanted more spending on education, basic technology, medical research and transportation. Chairman Greenspan initially signed onto Social Security finding but later argued for debt reduction. The Republicans all called for tax cuts. One prominent House Republican argued that all taxes, except for the payroll tax, should be cut. Chairman Greenspan said that a tax cut would be better suited for a time when the economy has turned down.", "In fiscal year 1998 employment was at record levels, inflation was low and Interest rates were down. In FY1999 President Clinton assumed economic growth of 2% per year. Clinton proposed using 62% of a projected budget surplus of $4.4 trillion over 15 years to pay down Social Security debt, 15% for Medicare, 12% for individual retirement accounts, 11% for defense and education. $2.3 trillion of the surplus would come in the final, least predictable 5 years. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan warned it was \"impossible\" to project budget surpluses 15 years into the future. By July 1999, the projected surplus was $2.9 trillion over 10 years -- $5.9 trillion over 15 years. An unofficial, worst-case surplus estimate was only $100 billion over 10 years. Republicans agreed to use 62% of the surplus for Social Security debt, wanted $778 billion over 10 years in tax cuts, and lower income tax rates. The rest would go to Medicare, veterans benefits and K-12 schools, funding for which had been frozen to reduce annual deficits. Democrats proposed a demographically targeted $300 billion tax cut over 10 years. Greenspan bluntly warned against immediate tax cuts. In February 2000 Greenspan advocated using the surplus to buy down the national debt and was emphatically against spending projected surpluses that may not even occur. Presidential candidates George Bush and Al Gore both promised to put $2.4 trillion of the surplus in a Social Security \"lock box\". By Sept. 2000 the projected \"surplus\" was $4.6 trillion over 10 years."]}

Do differences remain over the status of the Falkland Islands?", "summaries": ["Argentina was still obsessed with the Falkland Islands even in 1994, 12 years after its defeat in the 74-day war with Britain. The country's overriding foreign policy aim continued to be winning sovereignty over the islands. Relations between Argentina and Britain began improving after President Carlos Menem took office in 1989 and adopted pro-western foreign policies and free market economics. In theory, stronger trade and investment links with Argentina would gradually reduce the importance of the Falklands to Britain. Diplomatic relations resumed in 1990, and trade and investment between the two increased substantially. But the UK foreign office insisted its policy would change only if the islands' 2,000 inhabitants agreed. Argentina pressed for greater involvement in developing Falklands' natural resources, and in 1991, the UK agreed to cooperate to conserve fisheries. But Argentina began to issue fishing licenses, muslcing in on the main source of revenue for the islands. Britain had hoped to strike an agreement with Argentina that would protect the islands' revenues, but Argentina tied such an agreement to concessions by London over shared development of the islands' possible oil reserves and lifting of the UK's arms embargo. British Gas and YPF, Argentina's state-owned oil company, began negotiating jointly exploring offshore gas and oilfields bordering the Falkland Islands in April, 1993. In January, 1994, the British indicated readiness to allow Argentine companies to take part in the development of oilfields in the Falkland Islands' territorial waters, provided they acknowledged that any oil extracted belonged to Britain.", "Argentina and Great Britain engaged in a war in 1982 over the Falkland Islands, islands in the South Atlantic claimed by Argentina but occupied by Britain. After the war, Britain imposed an arms embargo and Argentina imposed restrictions on imports from Britain. Relations between Argentina and Britain eventually improved: in 1989, Argentina lifted restrictions on imports from Britain, and they cooperated during 1991 Gulf War. Full diplomatic relations between the two countries resumed in February 1990. Argentina made discreet attempts to resume military ties, but was rebuffed and the arms embargo continued. Carlos Memen assumed the office of President of Argentina in 1991 and adopted free-market and pro-western policies which made trade with Argentina and investments there more attractive. Trade between Argentina and Britain then began to recover. Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment. Britain reduced the cost of insurance protecting against possible losses resulting from investments in Argentina. In 1993, for the first time since the war, high-level ministers from both countries exchanged visits. A British consortium bought Argentina's largest gas distribution company in a privatization auction. Both countries held talks regarding joint oil and gas projects in Falkland waters. Argentina also hoped to attract British investment in their privatized nuclear industry. Two continuing sources of tension between Argentina and Britain have been Argentina's Falkland sovereignty claims and Britain's efforts to protect Falkland fishing revenues from illex squid, also competed for by Argentine and Asian fisherman and thought to be over-exploited.", "Thirteen years after the war between Britain and Argentina over the Falkland Islands, Argentina still makes a ritual reference to Argentina's sovereignty over those islands. However, Britain continues to maintain sovereignty. In most other areas, relations between the two countries have steadily improved. Diplomatic relations were fully restored in 1985. In late 1992 and early the next year, major cabinet ministers visited each other countries. In 1994, the Duke of York, became the first royal visitor to Argentina since the Falklands War. Economic and commercial relations between the two countries steadily improved. Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department resumed insurance cover to Argentina. That country hopes to attract UK investment in its nuclear industry and would have no objection to British companies operating its nuclear power stations. The two countries planned to develop oil resources in the South Atlantic jointly. A consortium led by British Gas bought the largest gas distribution company in Argentina. Although the UK and Argentina cooperated militarily during the Gulf War, Britain has maintained an arm embargo preventing Argentina from replacing aircraft shot down in the Falklands War. Argentina demanded an investigation of alleged war crimes during the Falklands War after reports of atrocities appeared in British media. Some differences and even anger exist between Argentina and Britain over territorial sea claims and fishing rights in the South Atlantic.", "Britain resumed trade with Argentina in 1985. In 1989 Argentina welcomed British imports. In 1990 diplomatic ties resumed. Britain lifted military protection zones around the islands. Each side gives advance notice of military exercises. Argentines visit war cemeteries in the Falklands. Britain refutes Argentina's claims of sovereignty over the Falklands, disputed since 1833. Argentina's main objective remains recovering sovereignty of the Falklands, thinking economic links would reduce the Falkland's importance to Britain. Argentina \"respects\" the islands' \"history\", but won't recognize its local government. Britain's arms embargo continues, except for Argentine units participating with Gulf War Coalition forces. Argentine military officers train in the UK. Britain won't grant Argentine President Menem's request to visit the UK. Ministers have been exchanged. After 1990, rapid UK trade growth helped Argentina's \"miracle\" economic recovery. Argentina wants UK regulatory expertise in privatization and private sector investment in Argentina's gas and nuclear industries. British Gas bought the largest Argentine gas company and exploits off-shore gas with Argentine companies. A 1993 fisheries conservation agreement changed Argentine policies which threatened depletion of fragile fish populations. Britain angered Argentina by extending territorial waters to 200-miles around South Georgia and South Sandwich islands, which Argentina claims, and when it extended fisheries control within the Falkland's 200-mile limit. Argentina briefly banned UK cattle imports and opened investigations into allegations of Falkland War atrocities by British soldiers. In 1993 British business insurance covered UK companies in Argentina. In 1994 Britain indicated readiness for Argentine companies to participate in Falkland's off-shore oil development.", "The return to normal relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina has been gradual since the end of the 1982 Falklands War. Full diplomatic ties were resumed in February 1990. In 1993, several high level visits were exchanged. Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Agricultural Minister Gillian Shephard visited Argentina. Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo and Foreign Minister Guido De Tella went to the UK. In 1994, Britian's Prince Andrew made an official royal visit and Carlos Bastos, Argentine energy minister, went to London. Economic relations resumed much earlier and have been stronger. Britain ended trade curbs in 1985 and Argentina lifted restrictions in 1989. By 1991, British Gas was involved in gas production and distribution. Joint exploration was being discussed. Britain's Export Credit Guarantee Department resumed insurance for exports to Argentina. Other economic areas included livestock techniques, privatization of Argentina's nuclear industry, and sharing of fishing resources. Military cooperation was much slower. Britain did lift the 150-mile military protection zone around the Falklands in 1990, but the UK arms embargo, begun in 1982, continued through 1994. Talks over resuming training Argentine officers in UK military academies were planned The two nations agree to disagree over the sovereignty of the Falklands. Argentina's overriding aim is to regain sovereignty. British conservatives want no concessions and the policy is that the status will change only when the Falklanders, who do not trust Argentina, want a change. Key economic issues are selling licenses for the valuable illex squid fishing rights and oil exploration.", "Argentine-British relations since the Falkland Islands War in 1982 have gradually improved. Argentine, however, steadfastly refuses to relinquish its claim to sovereignty over the Falklands. GB continues to refuse to discuss sovereignty formulas. This remains the only issue that seriously divides the two nations. Relations began to improve significantly when the newly elected president of Argentina, Carlos Menem, began to policy of rapprochement in 1989. His aim was to draw GB into a close relationship by opening talks on trade, oil and fishing rights, and military affairs. He began in August 1989 by lifting financial and trade restrictions on imports from Britain imposed during the Falkland Islands War. In early 1990, both countries agreed to restore full diplomatic ties and GB lifted a 150-mile military protection zone enforced around the islands. These developments were followed by a visit to London by Guido di Tella, Argentine foreign minister, to hold financial and trade discussions. In February 1992, both countries began discussions in Buenos Aires on developing South Atlantic oil resources. In December 1992, a British consortium bought out the Buenos Aires gas distribution company. Throughout 1993, a series of British high-level officials visited Argentina; notably, UK foreign secretary Douglas Hurd, the UK trade and industry secretary, and UK agriculture minister, Gillian Shephard, Argentina's economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, and its foreign minister, Guido di Tella, visited London. These exchanges resulted in greatly improved financial, oil, fisheries, and military issues but GB consistently refused to address the issue of sovereignty over the Falklands.", "Since the 1982 war over the Falkland Islands, relations between Argentina and Britain have steadily improved. Full diplomatic relations resumed in 1990, and senior British and Argentine officials have visited in London and Buenos Aires.

Argentina lifted financial and trade restrictions on British imports and has encouraged British investment, including in its soon-to-be privatized nuclear industry. Representatives from both countries have discussed the possibility of jointly developing offshore gas and oil fields bordering the Falklands' waters. Also, British and Argentine scientists have begun joint research in fish conservation. Issues remain concerning military ties between the two countries. Britain still has not lifted the arms embargo it imposed against Argentina following the 1982 war, and refuses to do so. However, relations have progressed steadily to the point where Britain and Argentina cooperated militarily during the 1991 Gulf War. Britain and Argentina have seen rapid improvement in relations since President Carlos Menem took office and adopted pro-western foreign policies. However, one issue continues to divide the two. Argentina refuses to surrender sovereignty over the Falkland Islands, despite losing the 1982 war. Consequently, the Falklands' fishing and oil resources continue to be a source of friction. Although they made a one-year arrangement to share fish resources, Argentina is tying any long-term agreement to British concessions to share oil development and lift the arms embargo.

Commercial relations improved steadily. Argentina sought UK expertise on privitization and agriculture. British export insurance resumed. British Gas bought into and managed Argentine gas distribution. UK's Babcock International supplied inspection equipment to an Argentine nuclear power station. Argentina used fishing disputes to press for oil and military compromises. Its cut-rate fishing licenses for the illex squid threatened Falkland income and overfishing. Britain extended territorial waters into disputed areas. A squid quota agreement was reached. Oil and gasfields detected in disputed waters required Argentine cooperation for development, but Britain claimed ownership of any oil. A British-imposed military protection zone around the Falklands was removed. Each side would announce upcoming military exercises. Britain and Argentina co-operated during the 1991 Gulf War and Argentine units received UK-manufactured spare parts. This stopped. Britain blocked an Argentine military transport from landing in London, and dissuaded the US from selling fighter bombers to Argentina. Argentine officer training at British academies resumed. Argentinians visited war cemeteries in the Falklands and Scotland Yard investigated British war crimes in Argentina. Sovereignty was not discussed. Argentina did not recognize local Falklands government. Menem claimed rapprochement with Britain rather than confrontation would restore Argentina's Falklands sovereignty by 2000. London insisted co-operation did not imply sovereignty recognition.", "Although there are still remaining issues regarding the Falkland Islands, relations between Argentina and Great Britain are growing continuously cooperative. President Carlos Menem of Argentina who took office in 1989 has adopted a pro-western foreign policy and free market economics. This has paved the way to economic and diplomatic relations with Great Britain. Argentina has sought British assistance on privatization of the oil and gas industries and the development of oil resources. Economic disputes still exist over the fishing industry in the waters around the Falkland Islands, particularly the lucrative illex squid fishing. In 1994, an agreement was finally reached between the two countries over quotas and regulations of the industry. Also in 1994, Britain's Export Credit Guarantee Department began underwriting loans to Argentina again. The refusal of Argentina to purchase cattle products because of an outbreak in the UK of mad cow disease in the 1980s created new tensions between the two countries. Diplomatic relations have continued to improve with state visits to Argentina by foreign secretary Douglas Hurd and a year later a visit to Britain by foreign minister Guido di Tella of Argentina. In 1994 Britain's Duke of York was the first official royal visitor to Argentina. Militarily, both countries joined forces to support the first Iraq war.

The plane dropped at near supersonic speed for 9,000 meters, then climbed for 2,400 meters before falling and breaking apart. There were no radio reports of trouble. Initial speculation centered on a thrust reverser (deactivated in Cairo). The flight recorder was recovered on November 9 and revealed that the autopilot was disconnected, the descent appeared \"controlled,\" the cockpit turned off both engines, and the elevators were out of unison. An on-board computer failure, stopping the transponder and providing erroneous data, was speculated. A criminal act involving a hijacking, suicide, or a crew fight was also possible and the background, medical history, and emotional stability of the passengers and crew were examined. The cockpit voice recorder was recovered on November 15. It contained the co-pilot chanting, \"I rely on God\" and the pilot ordering actions to control the aircraft. The National Transportation Safety Board stated on January 21, 2000 that there was no sign of mechanical failure. Egyptian officials continued to seek other possible causes. A \"triangle of death\" over the Atlantic was blamed. Then \"something happened\" to the tail. In August there were rumors that classified radar showed three high-speed returns in the area along the path of the flight. Several pilots reported seeing fireballs in the area at different times. The Egyptians continued to blame technical problems, primarily the elevator control system. In September, a computer shutdown caused by electromagnetic interference from military radars was speculated.", "The October 1999 crash of EgyptAir flight 990 was evaluated for mechanical defects, operational errors, or human sabotage. The plane plummeted 15,000 feet, but then climbed 8000 feet before its final fall to the ocean. There was no distress call, and an emergency descent was virtually ruled out. The tail elevators were in uneven positions, indicating a possible malfunction, but it is not known if this was a cause or byproduct of the crash. Boeing did step up inspections of its elevator systems. An in-flight electrical problem could explain why the transponder stopped working, and computer failure could lead to erratic behavior as the pilots tried to regain control. However, thorough evaluation of the flight data recorder, cockpit voice recorder, radar data, and wreckage led investigators to determine there was no sign of mechanical failure. EgyptAir said this was its best crew, but there were strange operational events. Both engines had been switched off from the cockpit, something experienced pilots would not do. The autopilot was switched off and the plane went into a controlled steep dive. Investigators found little in recent activities, background, medical history, and emotional stability of crew and passengers. Further investigation showed the co-pilot was the subject of several investigations by New York hotel security police. The prayer he uttered and final comments on the cockpit voice recorder led investigators to suspect his suicide. Electromagnetic interferences by local military radars could have caused shutdown of computerized autopilot, elevators, and engines, but radar evidence is classified.", "Shortly after taking off from John F. Kennedy International Airport for Cairo, EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic early Sunday, October 31, 1999, killing all 217 people on board. Flight data showed that as it flew at 33,000 feet, the aircraft's automatic pilot was shut off, throttles cut back, and engines shut off from the cockpit. Electrical power ceased, turning off the transponder and flight data recorder. According to Air Force radar, the plane suddenly entered a drastically steep dive to 16,000 feet, slowed and climbed back to 24,000 feet, then turned again in its fatal plunge. Radio communication between the crew and air traffic controllers was routine and they did not advise of either an emergency or mechanical problem before or during the dive. The cockpit voice recorder captured someone uttering a prayer before the autopilot disengaged. Initial speculation that malfunctioning reverse thrusters caused the crash was disproved. Some speculated that an in-flight electrical or computer problem caused the crash. Flight data indicated the tail section elevators moved out of unison. Other lingering theories include hijacking, terrorism, crew fight, or a deliberate criminal or suicidal act by the backup copilot. Egyptian officials dispute these theories, saying the likely cause was an unexplained problem in the plane's elevator control system, a missile, a bomb, or electromagnetic interference. After extensive investigation of recovered aircraft parts and both black box data recorders, NTSB investigators found no evidence that mechanical or electrical problems or an explosion caused the crash.", "The cause of the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 off Nantucket in October 1999 may never be known with absolute certainty. The Boeing 767 was en route from JFK Airport to Egypt. There were no survivors. Radar tracks of the flight during its final minutes indicated the plane went into a dive but climbed again before going into an extremely steep dive during which some breaking up of the plane occurred. The plane's autopilot was disconnected either deliberately or by itself before the plane descended. One thrust reverser had been previously deactivated because of a problem and there was speculation that a thrust reverser had deployed. The transponder had also stopped working. Neither pilot nor co-pilot sent a distress message. Data from one Black Box showed that both engines had been switched off from the cabin and that the elevators, which raise or lower the plane's nose were in an uneven setting, a move not believed possible for the crew to make. Cockpit voice recordings indicated that someone uttered a prayer in Arabic just before the autopilot disengaged raising questions of a possible terrorist or suicide act. The terrorist theory was raised because several Egyptian Army officers were on board. The plane's copilot had been having problems and had exhibited strange behavior in a New York hotel before the flight suggesting he may have deliberately crashed the plane. Egyptian authorities discounted the suicide theory and raised the possibility that the plane's problems were caused by electromagnetic interference from military radars."]}
{"id": "D0616G", "query": "How have the Chechen militants elected to fight against the Russian government? What is the Russian response to the militancy and what toll is it taking on both sides?", "summaries": ["Chechen rebels have fought against the Russian government with guerilla hit-and-run tactics and terrorist attacks such as bombings and kidnappings. Terrorist attacks have been launched in major Russian cities as well as in border lands and Chechnya itself. The Russian response has included all-out attempts to occupy Chechnya in 1994-96 and after August 2, 1999, securing borders with Chechnya, air strikes and artillery attacks. Sometimes the air strikes, and artillery strikes have been against cities and strategic targets and at other times against Chechen positions including those in mountainous terrain. Attempts to subdue Chechen militants through occupation of their homeland have proved costly and ineffective. The 1994-96 war cost tens of thousands of lives before Russian forces withdrew. Two months after the second attempt was launched in 1999 Russian forces had occupied only 1/3 of Chechnya. Russians claimed that air strikes had killed more than 2,000 Chechen rebels and that occupation forces had killed at least 1500 militants with loss of only 47 Russian servicemen. The Chechens said air strikes had killed 550 civilians and that Russian troop losses totaled 1500 compared to 32 for the Chechens. In November 1999 Russia announced its intent to liberate all of Chechnya by February 2000, but by May 2000 only 2/3 of the country was occupied and weekly losses continued on both sides. On July 20, 2000 the Russian government announced its troop casualties since Aug. 2, 1999 as 2,518 killed and 7,950 wounded. Guerilla and terrorist attacks continued.", "In December 1994 Russian troops were sent into Chechnya to crush a separatist drive led by Dzhokhar Dudayev. In March 1996 Boris Yeltsin halted the offensive, initiating a partial withdrawal from Chechen areas, but warned that more terrorist attacks would be dealt with severely. He promised free and democratic elections and suggested amnesty for some combatants. At this time Chechnya won de facto independence and could run its own affairs, but was left devastated and lawless. To prevent the spread of violence Russia spent the next year strengthening the border areas but did not send troops into Chechnya itself. Yeltsin expressed support for Chechnya's government and intended to resume negotiations. By 1999, under Putin, Russian air raids continued escalating along the Chechen border to combat aggression. They first bombed suspected rebel bases, then economic installations and civilian communications facilities. Chechens blamed Russia for many civilian deaths. Russia began its military operations inside Chechnya in late September after Chechen rebels' armed incursions into neighboring Dagestan and a spate of terrorist acts in Russian cities that killed over 300. Russia was determined to liberate Chechnya from the terrorists and restore normal life and by the end of 1999 Russian troops occupied over 60% of Chechnya. However, the rebels geared up again and during 2000 launched isolated attacks, turning to bombings and the hit-and-run tactics that were effective in 1994-1996. The turbulence resulted in thousands of Chechens trying to leave the republic, and many human rights issues came under examination .", "After fifteen months of fighting against Chechen separatists since December 1994, the Russian government announced its intention to withdraw troop stage-by-stage from Chechnya in an effort to end the conflict. Some troops will stay behind and respond to any attacks from the rebels. The status of the rebel republic is still problematical. The Russians say Chechnya must stay within the Russian Confederation. The Russian government tightened security on the border with Chechnya in March of 1998 in response to rebel commanders' statements that they would continue the war, including terrorist activities against Russia, until Russia recognized Chechnya independence. Armed Chechen rebels also began detaining hundreds of Russian hostages in return for heavy ransoms or release of imprisoned Chechens. In August 1998, Russia launched a massive anti-terrorist military campaign in Chechnya after separatists invaded the neighboring republic of Dagestan and carried out a series of incursions and explosions claiming the lives of over 300 people in several Russian cities, including Moscow. The Russians sent in some 30,000 troops to partition Chechnya and push the rebels into the mountains. Russian air strikes were conducted against economic installations, communications facilities, rebel bases, storage areas, bridges, and roads. By November 2000, the Russians occupied 60% of Chechen territory and drove some 2500 rebels into the mountain areas. Some 3,600 Chechen civilians were killed and almost 200,000 fled the country. The Russians registered 2,518 killed, 7,956 wounded, and claimed that \"decades of thousands\" of rebels were killed. The Russians continue to face rebel \"hit-and-run\" attacks.", "The Chechen Republic, or Chechnya, is a small Muslim nation that was part of the Soviet Union. During the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the republic declared its independence. Russia maintained that Chechnya did not have the right to secede. This situation led to armed conflicts between Chechen forces and the Russian army. Russia sent troops to the Caucus region in December 1994 in an attempt to crush separatist fighters. A war raged between 1994 and 1996, which proved humiliating and costly to Moscow, with the loss of thousands of Russian lives. In 1996, accords were signed granting Chechnya de facto independence. Moscow still claimed Chechnya is part of Russia and struggled to keep violence from spreading to the rest of the Caucasus region. In August and September of 1999, armed Chechen groups invaded neighboring Dagestan, inflicting heavy casualties on Russian troops. A series of bomb blasts that killed about 300 people was attributed to Chechen rebels. Russia used these incidents as an excuse to invade Chechnya, and mounted aerial and artillery attacks against rebel positions. Russia claimed that separatists were planning terrorist attacks inside Russia. Up to 200,000 people were thought to have fled Chechnya since the Russians began their offensive, and some 3,600 people, mainly civilians, were killed according to Chechen leaders. Rebel attacks included hostage taking, ambushes, hit-and-run attacks, suicide bombings, booby traps, and shooting at military and police posts and at polling stations. In mid-2000, Russia claimed they suffered 2,240 killed and 6,372 wounded."]}

{"id": "D366I", "query": "What commercial applications exist for cyanide? What industries is it used in? How is it used? What are its potential dangers? What real damage has commercially-used cyanide caused?", "summaries": ["Cost efficient \"heap-leach technology,\" using cyanide, revolutionized gold mining in the 1970s. On huge plastic pads, heaps of pulverized ore from strip mines are saturated with a cyanide solution. In this cost effective method, cyanide bonds to bits of gold and the solution is then drained into holding ponds where the gold separates out. The dangers of cyanide use in gold mining are its potential for environmental contamination. Waste ponds foul the air, and water leaks into streams, poisoning the fish and contaminating water. Birds drink from ponds and die by the thousands. Water in a waste pond in Mojkovak, Montenegro, gave off a mist that affected people's breathing and caused a doubling of lung cancer cases in the two years prior to February, 1992. In Colorado, in 1994, a mine leaked contaminated water into the Alamosa River. Within a year it had poisoned all the fish in a reservoir 15 miles downstream and threatened irrigation in the valley below. Other uses for cyanide are in galvanizing and other metal plating, in recovering silver from photographs and x-rays, and in fishing. Fisheries in parts of the Philippines have been decimated by the use of cyanide in fishing. Five young men working in a California plating plant died in 1989 from inhaling cyanide fumes in a confined space. In 1990, a worker died recovering silver from X-rays. In Los Angeles, dumping of thousands of gallons of cyanide solution from plating operations into sewers occurred several times in 1989 and 1990.", "Cyanide and cyanide compounds, as hydrogen and sodium cyanide, are used in mining processes, electroplating, manufacturing, and other commercial applications. In the heap-leaching process used to extract gold and silver, ore is first placed in a heap on an impermeable plastic pad and then a weak cyanide solution is sprinkled over the ore. The solution collects at the bottom after percolating through the ore and dissolving most of the ore. A similar process is used to process copper mined from open-air pits. Electroplating of metal parts, such as aircraft parts, involves placing the parts in cyanide and acid baths. Hydrogen cyanide is used in manufacturing chemicals, such as tryptophan and other amino acids. Cyanide is also used to recover silver from X-ray film. Cyanide entering air, water, or the soil from commercial activities could have adverse impacts on animals and plants. Waste in the ponds produced by leaching gold from ore and in the pits produced by leaching copper from ore is a source of potential environmental dangers: drinking their toxic solution could kill wildlife; and leaks and overflows from them and their flooding could contaminate groundwater, kill fish and aquatic life, and endanger fisheries. Concerns about potentially harmful effects of mining waste also could cause tourism to decrease. Commercially used cyanide has caused real damage. Work-related deaths have resulted from inhaling cyanide fumes. More than 6,400 migratory birds and other animals were killed in Nevada by drinking water in the cyanide-laced ponds produced by gold mining operations.", "Gold mining operations make extensive use of cyanide. A process known as heap-leach or heap mining is used to extract gold from low-grade ore. The ore is spread on impermeable plastic pads then sprinkled with a weak cyanide-water mixture. Unfortunately, in some cases runoff from this cyanide process has discharged into ponds with the result that birds and animals were killed. Some mining companies went to a \"closed loop\" leaching system that does away with open ponds. Cyanide is used in electroplating aircraft parts. The process involves placing the part in a large cyanide and acid baths. Several instances have occurred in which cyanide used by electroplating companies has been improperly stored resulting in dangerous situations and causing expensive clean-ups. Hydrogen cyanide has been used to produce amino acid nutritional supplements. Some Filipinos use cyanide in dangerous and destructive (to coral reefs) fishing operations. Cyanide is used in rodent poison. Cyanide used to recover silver from X-ray film caused the death of a worker when he inhaled fumes from the process.", "In mining industry applications a 0.1% cyanide-water solution cheaply leaches metals, such as gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead and iron from ore heaps. Other techniques, \"pressure oxidation\", \"roasting\" and soil-loving bacteria, are less efficient. Cyanide-leaching recovers silver from photographic film; is used to make PCP; and in Cameroon, pygmies harvest honey stun bees with cyanide-laced smoke. In mining, open ponds of cyanide and toxic metal waste, leak or flood into the environment. Thousands of birds and animals die drinking from poisoned waste water ponds. Flora, fauna and humans die from direct contact with concentrated waste; which then flows into tributaries, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, resulting in massive kills of fish, animals and plants, and corrosion of irrigation equipment even 17 miles or more down stream, before cyanide is diluted or deactivated by sunlight. Over time, even small amounts build up in human tissue. Evaporation from cyanide waste ponds affects breathing. Diseases include lung-cancer, and central-nervous system illnesses, like suicide. Diversion of water for leaching destroys wildlife habitats. Cyanide waste cleanup is expensive. A pioneering \"closed-loop\" cyanide leaching system eliminates open ponds and environment leaks. It is cheaper, uses less cyanide and operates year-round when open heaps freeze. Cyanide in galvanizing and plating produces toxics like silica, calcium, iron and zinc. Soap-like alternatives exist. Cyanide in rodent poison absorbs topically and produces poison gas and toxic run-off in fires. Accidentally combining acids with cyanide produces deadly hydrogen cyanide gas. Hydrogen cyanide contaminates manufactured amino-acids. Sodium cyanide use by fisherman decimates fish.", "Cyanide is used in gold/silver/copper mining in a process known as \"heap leaching\" in which a weak cyanide solution is poured over low-grade ore to leach out the metal. The process leaves a toxic residue containing cyanide, which gradually is neutralized if left in the sunlight. Problems arise if a dam breaks or if the pond or container leaks or overflows poisoning ground water or nearby streams and killing fish and other wildlife. In desert locations ponds can directly kill wildlife that find the toxic water irresistible. Nevada officials reported 6400 migratory birds and other animals including deer, coyotes, kit fox, rabbits and chipmunks killed at Nevada gold mines employing heap leaching 1984-88. Another use of cyanide commercially is in metal coating, plating or galvanization. As with heap leaching, disposal of the resulting toxic sludge is a problem and plating companies have been sued for contaminating sewers or ground water. In one case five workers at a plating company were asphyxiated by hydrogen cyanide while trying to clean a sludge tank. Cyanide is also used to remove silver from x-ray film, as an ingredient in rodent poison and in making amino acids. It has been found in illegal drug labs and is used by Muru-ami fishermen in the Philippines to drive fish from the coral reefs. At the very outskirts of commerce, Baka pygmies in southeastern Cameroon use a cyanide compound to stun bees while raiding their nests for honey.", "Cyanide is used widely for many purposes but most extensively in gold, silver, and copper mining, in electroplating, x-ray film recovery, and in the production of pharmaceuticals. In some isolated cases, it is used for fishing and food gathering. It is also used in gas chambers in the US penal system. Cyanide is used extensively in gold mining through a system called \"heap leach\" mining, which enables microscopic bits of gold to be economically extracted from low-grade ore. The process involves piling heaps of ore dug from strip mines and leaching it with a cyanide solution that bonds to the bits of gold. The solution-coated ore is then drained into a holding pond where the gold is separated from the solution. Plating companies electroplate metal, such as that used by military and aerospace contractors, by placing it in large cyanide and acid baths. In the Philippines some fishermen use homemade explosives and cyanide for driving fish away from reefs and into nets. In Cameroon, a pygmy tribe uses smoking leaves and a cyanide compound for stunning bees while retrieving honey. While the processing systems are generally safe, a number of dangerous situations may occur. If toxic waste containing cyanide is not disposed of properly, it may drain into ponds, streams, sewers, and reservoirs. This results in the destruction of fish and wildlife or may cause death to humans from breathing poisonous air or drinking contaminated water. Improper storage can create poisonous fumes and fires by mixing with other gasses.", "Cyanide is used in mining to extract precious metals from low-grade ore. The heap-leach technique uses a water-cyanide solution to dissolve gold, silver, or copper from the ore. Cyanide also is used to extract precious metals from ore in open pits and tanks. Mine waste-water poses an environmental hazard. Leaks contaminate waterways and groundwater. A leak into the Alamosa River poisoned fish in a downstream reservoir and corroded irrigation equipment in the valley. A broken dam spilled cyanide-contaminated water into a creek. The death of hundreds of birds and other wild animals is alleged to have been caused by contaminated mining holding ponds. Water diverted for mining use can dry surrounding wells and streams, destroying wildlife habitats. Cyanide is used in the metal plating industry, where the storage tanks pose a risk of deadly hydrogen cyanide being accidentally released. Cyanide fumes killed five workers cleaning one tank. Environmental damage occurred when a leaking holding tank contaminated ground water and when a plating company dumped cyanide-laced waste water into the Los Angeles sewer system. Cyanide is used to extract silver from used x-ray films. An employee at one of these plants died after inhaling cyanide fumes on the job. Philippine fishermen use cyanide to catch fish. This method decimates the fish population and is linked to the destruction of area reefs. Some garden pesticides contain cyanide. A fire in a garden store could release dangerous fumes from stored pesticide. Another use of cyanide is in manufacturing the nutritional supplement tryptophan.", "Cyanide is used in mining to recover metal from low-yielding ore. Crushed ore is heaped on an impermeable pad and saturated with a cyanide solution that leaches out metal then drains into a holding pond. Potential dangers are pollution of water supplies, fisheries and air; poisoning of wildlife; lack of mine-operator diligence; and hazardous materials left at abandoned mine sites. In Nevada, wildlife died by thousands from drinking at cyanide-laced holding ponds. In Summitville Colorado, pollution from a mountain mine killed fish for 17 miles and corroded irrigation equipment. In Montenegro, waste reservoir mists affected people's breathing. A South Carolina mine's reservoir dam broke and spilled sodium cyanide into a creek. Cyanide is used in the metal plating industry and to recover silver from used film. Dangers include improper working conditions, storage and disposal; and lack of rescue procedures. Seepage could contaminate ground water. Five plating company workers died when hydrogen cyanide gas was accidentally created while cleaning a holding tank. A film recovery worker died from inhaling cyanide fumes. Cyanide-contaminated sludge has been dumped into a Brazilian river and California sewers and trash bins. Cyanide is used in pesticides and PCP. Fires at associated stores and labs can't be fought because of dangers to firefighters from toxic fumes and pollutants in runoff from waterhoses. Philippine fishermen use cyanide in fishing, needlessly destroying immature fish. Cameroon honey gatherers use cyanide to stun bees. Cyanide is used in tryptophan production. Unregulated tryptophan use can amplify other drugs' effects and impair judgement.", "There are two major industries that use cyanide or cyanide compounds. The first use in the mining industry, known as heap leaching, is a very economical and efficient way to separate small traces of gold from rock. Ore is placed on a plastic pad and a weak cyanide solution is poured over it to pull the gold from the rock. The waste from this process is discharged into self-contained ponds. Environmental problems arise during times of heavy rainfall when ponds overflow and run into natural streams. Environmentalists say the runoff could pollute drinking water and endanger salmon fisheries. In addition, birds and other wildlife are endangered when they see the open blue cyanide ponds and stop to drink from them. Another industrial use of cyanide, in the form of hydrogen cyanide gas, is in the plating industry. There is a reported incident of five workers in Indiana dying of asphyxiation when working in an enclosed space in the presence of the cyanide gas. A plating company in Hollywood, California was charged with dumping cyanide into the sewer system and with reckless storage of chemicals. Another plating company in Burbank, California was closed by the EPA for reckless storage of chemicals including hydrogen cyanide. The Japanese use hydrogen cyanide to manufacture tryptophan, an amino acid used as a nutritional supplement. An unusual use of cyanide is to assist Cameroon villagers to gather honey from hives in tall trees. Climbers stun the bees with smoking leaves and a cyanide compound."]}
{"id": "D699A", "query": "What are the pros and cons of term limits? What are the similarities and differences among the arguments when term limits are considered at the federal, state and local levels?", "summaries": ["The issue of term limits is concerned with whether or not career politicians are good for the country, the state, or the locality. Proponents see career politicians as a threat. They argue that individuals in office for long periods lose their perspective and stop listening to constituents, that they block the rise of new leadership, and that to stay in office they are likely to bow to special interests groups and their money. Incumbents have an advantage in elections. In Congressional elections, 98 percent of incumbents seeking reelection win year after year. Proponents say that term limits will dilute the power of incumbents and will keep elected officials more accountable to the electorate and more likely to push for reforms. Opponents argue that term limits will produce newly elected officials highly dependent on the people around them. As a result, the functioning of government will not improve and the power of unelected officials, bureaucrats, and interest groups will increase. They say that term limits will force out talented, experienced, and highly regarded politicians with strong ties to their constituents. They also say that limits will take away voter's rights to select the elected officials they want. Pro and con arguments on term limit at the federal, state, and local levels are all very similar. Two differences about limits at the state level are, on the pro side, they could result in more minorities being elected; on the con side, with inexperienced legislators the Legislature could become dominated by the governor.", "The arguments for and against elected term-limits are virtually the same for local, state and federal government. The core issue is that incumbents are overwhelmingly favored in elections. Proponents of term limits argue that they have non-partisan support. Long elected service corrupts incumbents, making them exhausted, bored, arrogant and ethically complacent. Incumbents are unaccountable and don't challenge other incumbents in elections. Incumbents have recognition and special interest money unmatchable by challengers. Newly elected officials can undo the other party's gerrymandering. \"Citizen legislators\" will replace \"Lifetime politicians\", ensuring diverse views and expertise. Term limits constrain big machine politics. Proponents refute opponent claims that lobbyists corrupt new candidates more easily than incumbents. Some favor term-limits reluctantly; saying government is gridlocked by caution, incumbency protection and special interests immune to reform. Reasonable terms are needed to develop experience. Until challengers compete more equally, term limits will be imposed, and oust good officials. Those opposed say term limits undemocratically eliminate voter choice and violate the Voting Rights Act. Women and Latinos will have a harder time staying in office. There will be fewer middle-aged candidates. Term limits strengthen bureaucracies and increase conflict-of-interest pressures. Term limited officials focus on short-term issues, not long-term solutions. When minority parties use term limits to get better represented, they undermine the separation of powers. Opponents rebut proponents' claims. \"New\" is not \"better\". Experience in office is not a liability. Voters can kick out bad officials. Term limits per se don't improve government process. Term limits increase special interest power.", "Proponents of term limits say that they would end politics as a profession and create more citizen-type legislators. Incumbents have too much money, protection, and perquisites. They lose their perspective and stop listening to the people. Limits would force more competition and turnovers, and give people more control because officials would be less prone to special interests. Some feel that term limits would deter the ethical lapses that result from complacency. Mayors in power for many terms can become exhausted, corrupt, bored, or arrogant. Winners in office too long block new leadership and forward movement. Opponents of term limits say they would place even more power in the hands of the executive branch, lobbyists, legislative staffs, and bureaucrats. They would drive out good politicians along with the bad and deprive the citizen of the right to vote for who they want in office. Many believe legislation is a complicated task and people need experience to do their job well or handle leadership positions. Lame ducks would be more interested in their next job than the current one and be susceptible to private interests that would be providing these jobs. Women and minorities believe they would be hurt by term limits. At the local level the interest is much greater in bringing in new people and new ideas and allowing people to move up into higher level jobs. At the national-level, seniority becomes a major concern with the more senior legislators being able to bring benefits in to their jurisdictions.", "Arguments for term limits are that incumbents with fund-raising advantages and name recognition are virtually certain of reelection over challengers, diminishing competition. Winners stay in office too long, inviting exhaustion, corruption, boredom, arrogance, loss of perspective and unresponsiveness. Running the may motivate them. New leaders dealing with recurring issues could benefit the country. 8-12 years is a reasonable time to make a contribution. Support for term-limits spans the political spectrum. Legislating in the people's interest can be learned fast. Balancing special interests and intrigues take time to learn. Arguments against term limits are that high-quality, experienced leaders are forced out, leaving inexperienced, less powerful amateurs to run a complex government. Lame ducks would increase. Short-timers without tenure wouldn't have a stake in their job and could be influenced by future prospects. Term limits deny voters their democratic right to elect whom they choose and to hold people responsible. Learning the system takes time. Term limits would strengthen the unelected, unresponsive, unaccountable, inaccessible bureaucracy and staff, and the power of special interests. New candidates need interest-group money to achieve name recognition. Term limits are detrimental to underrepresented minorities. Similar arguments apply to local term limits, although legal opinion is divided over term limits for cities, which could come under state law. Term limits would encourage more people to run, bringing a variety of members and expertise. Citizen-legislators would replace professional politicians and reduce bossism. There would be constant opportunity for upward mobility. Critics argue lawmakers would be obsessed by moving up."]}
{"id": "D428E", "query": "Where are birth rates declining? What are the reasons for declining birth rates? What are the effects of a declining birth rate?", "summaries": ["Birth rates have dropped among both poor and prosperous countries in the last 40 years, including Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, Britain, Bulgaria, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Morocco, Namibia, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, Tunisia, and Turkey. Italy has shown the biggest drop. Lower birth rates are closely connected to availability of contraception. Development, improved health services, education, and job opportunities for women contribute. Land shortages and urbanization reduce the need for home-grown workforces. Other reasons for falling birth rates include falling living standards (Russia), social unease and abolition of child benefits (former East Germany), increased prosperity (Italy and Spain), government family planning promotion (Egypt, Iran), forced sterilizations and abortions (China), UN overestimation of fertility (the Maghreb), social welfare systems replacing the need for offspring to care for aging parents (Britain, Germany), disregard of Catholic anti-contraception dictates (Ireland), and women's emancipation (Tunisia). Declining birth rates solve unemployment problems but add to shortages of skilled labor. Women are targeted for recruitment. Imported labor is increasingly important but large immigrant populations bring problems. Immigration and citizenship policies may need changing. Meanwhile, falling Maghreb birth rates mean less export labor for Europe. Japanese labor shortages increase factory robot importance, empower workers, and produce better working conditions, while worker mobility erodes company loyalty. Japan and Germany face loss of economic power. Reduction in a tax-paying workforce reduces funding for social welfare, prompting new economic structures, reduced benefits, and toughened fraud inspections. Declining military manpower could mean greater reservist use and changed deployment strategies.", "The most notable decline in birth rates is in the developed countries such as North America, Japan and Western Europe. Increased wealth, better and more available birth control, women working, and conscious decisions to limit family size contribute to this trend. The results include a drop in the available manpower, both for military conscription and labor. Labor shortages are prompting investment in automation technology, improved working conditions, more female workers, and foreign workers. The aging population will result in problems supporting health care systems and pensioner programs, and a decline in the manufacturing sector with a rise in the service sector. In the early 1990's the birth rates were also declining in the formerly Communist countries. The economic turmoil and the end of government support for larger families caused this decline. Improving economic conditions lowered the birth rates in the emerging Turkey and Ireland. Birth rates also were beginning to fall in much of the less developed world, including Brazil, Africa, Iran, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India, and China. The improved availability and acceptability of birth control, the emancipation and education of women, urbanization of some segments of the population, and fear of a looming land shortage in other segments, all contributed. Government policy had a very strong effect from propaganda campaigns, to supplying free birth control advice and devices, to, in the case of China, limiting the number of children a couple could have. In these nations, gradual improvement in the standard of living has been the main result.", "A 1994 UN study shows a dramatic drop in fertility rates around the world in the past forty years. Generally speaking, this has been explained by a link between low birth rates and economic wealth but the study shows otherwise. Some countries have achieved steep falls in birth rates despite relative lack of economic growth, while others maintain large average family styles despite relatively high levels of economic prosperity. In Western Europe, the birth rate is declining primarily because people are becoming more educated which influences them to marry later and have fewer children. In Germany, Spain, Italy, and Ireland, in particular, lower birth rates are due to the fact that women are realizing their importance to the job market and their capacity to lead more independent lives and, hence, are increasingly using contraceptives. In the Middle East, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Iran have falling birth rates due primarily to the higher prevalence of contraception, rising education and literacy, and religious restrictions. Egypt, Tunisia and Iran, in fact, have instituted effective family planning programs. In South America, Brazil's rising education, rapid urbanization, and increasing use of contraception have significantly lowered its fertility rate. Japan's decline in birth is attributed to a new generation choosing to have longer careers and fewer children. These trends, however, are causing serious economic problems. There are fewer people for the labor force, which means less money for welfare, pensions, and health care, and more reliance on imported labor, all of which exacerbates social tensions.", "Birth rates are declining in most parts of the world. Overall, world population continues to grow but the rate of growth is slowing. This trend is even noted in Catholic countries, and in Islamic countries that until recently pressed for larger populations. Declining rates are most prevalent in developed countries but are beginning to occur in the Third World. The world's most populous country, China, has cut its fertility rate using harsh measurers. Some countries in Western Europe are experiencing birth rates barely at, or even below, the replacement rate. Russia with a low birth rate and a high death rate has experienced a significant population loss. Several factors account for the declining birth rate. An important one is that women in Third World countries are beginning to have educational opportunities and are becoming aware of family planning and contraceptive information. More women are beginning to enter the work force. More families are moving from rural areas where large families were desirable to urban areas where large families are less advantageous. One important effect of lower birth rates is a shortage of skilled labor and of manpower in general in First World countries. The work force in North America and Western Europe will only increase through immigration. More women will be in the workforce in the West. Falling birth rates are leading to a manpower shortage in the military forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."]}

Theft crimes involve theft of property or money, skimming money, or stealing money from criminals. Examples of fraud are mail fraud, bank fraud, securities fraud, fraudulent billing, investment fraud, falsifying documents, supplying fraudulent documents, and insurance fraud. Examples of commerce law violations are bribery, embezzlement, money laundering, illegal currency transactions, unauthorized loans, illegal banking activities, operating an illegal bank, illegal overseas funds transfers, fraudulent loan applications, pyramid schemes, ponzi schemes, illegal use of union funds, illegal federal campaign contributions, hidden ownership of a business, covering up ownership of ships, illegal gambling, conflict of interest, prohibited political and lobbying activities, personal enrichment from ministry funds, using personal long-distance phone calls from a federal government office, accepting kickbacks for contracts, facilitating illegal weapons sales, enterprise corruption, falsifying company records, manipulating trading losses, making payola payments, interstate transportation of obscene material; and illegal handling of immigrant residency, amnesty and work applications. Examples of obstruction are obstructing law enforcement, lying to federal officials, concealing illegal activity, not reporting a known crime, committing perjury, obstructing justice, and violating federal grand jury secrecy laws. Conspiracy includes racketeering, engaging in a pattern of racketeering, conspiracy to bribe, conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiracy to maintain a house of prostitution, and conspiracy to defraud. Drug crimes include distributing illegal drugs, narcotics activities, and smuggling drugs. Examples of vice crimes are running a house of prostitution, moral turpitude, prostitution activities, pimping, and pandering.", "Frequently tax-related charges are filed in criminal cases where there are or could be other criminal charges not related to taxes. Charges of conspiracy, fraud, racketeering and money laundering have been linked with charges of tax evasion. Accusations of mail fraud, stock fraud, illegal enterprises or banking activities may be connected with charges of tax evasion. In some of these cases only the tax-related charges are filed although there is obviously suspicion of the non-tax violations. In some cases a well-known mobster may escape prosecution for seemingly more serious crimes only to be convicted of tax evasion or tax fraud. Tax charges have been combined with indictment for running a house of prostitution, grand larceny, drug smuggling or other drug charges, and distribution of pornography. In one case charges of pimping and pandering that would require mandatory prison sentences were dropped in favor of charges of \"conspiring to maintain a house of prostitution\" and tax evasion. Payola, accepting kickbacks, embezzlement and sale of steroids have all been charged along with tax evasion or filing fraudulent tax returns. In an unusual case involving \"record industry racketeering\" a man was indicted on a bevy of criminal counts including \"racketeering, conspiracy to defraud Columbia Records, making undisclosed 'payola' payments to radio stations, mail fraud, filing false tax returns, conspiracy to distribute cocaine and conspiracy to impede the Internal Revenue Service.\"", "Federal tax evasion charges are brought against people for under-reporting legally earned income. Charges also brought against those with income obtained via illegal means and not fully reported. These tax evasion charges may be made instead of or in addition to one or more non-tax crimes. The kinds of non-tax crimes associated with tax evasion charges spans a wide spectrum, including theft, embezzlement, bribery, fraud, conspiracy, racketeering, money laundering, and drug-related crimes. Theft crimes include stealing money from the government, such as drug money seized by law enforcement officials; illegally using union funds; and skimming funds from a business, such as a gambling casino. Embezzlement crimes include stealing money from investors and law clients. Bribery crimes include both accepting and receiving bribes, payola, and kickbacks. Fraud crimes include investment fraud, such as manipulating trading losses for tax advantages, and running a Ponzi schemes where money from new investors are used to pay off old investors; defrauding insurance companies; over billing of law clients; creating bogus tax shelters; and engaging in mail and wire fraud. Conspiracy includes engaging in fraudulent activities with others to avoid paying taxes. Racketeering involves engaging in activities carried out by a criminal enterprise, such running an illegal house of prostitution. Money laundering involves providing legitimate sources for monies illegally obtained. Drug-related crimes include distributing cocaine and marijuana smuggling. State governments also bring charges for non-tax crimes. New York charged a group with enterprise corruption for setting up companies that conspired to avoid paying state fuel taxes.", "Income tax crimes often are prosecuted in conjunction with other crimes. Among the more common charges are conspiracy, fraud, money laundering, theft, embezzlement, drug trafficking, and mail fraud. Financial and investment crimes are usually linked with tax crimes. Examples of these would be illegal banking activities, stock, bank, and insurance fraud, pyramid or Ponzi investment schemes, stealing from clients, and illegal tax shelter schemes. Other non-tax crimes prosecuted along with tax crimes would include running a house of prostitution, bribery of public officials, interstate transport of obscene materials, payola, racketeering, theft of seized drug money, stealing government property, harboring a fugitive, and receiving kickbacks. Prosecutors often attempt to convict known or suspected criminals of tax charges when there are difficulties or delays in prosecuting their more egregious offenses. This strategy is often used against organized crime figures or mobsters. The same strategy was used to convict a California businessman who defrauded and preyed on Hispanic immigrants. Because he was considered a danger to the Latin community, he was prosecuted for failure to pay payroll taxes before the fraud investigation was completed. Occasionally, tax crimes are brought against individuals involved in politically sensitive situations. For example, a bank manager pleaded guilty to conspiracy, fraud, money laundering and tax evasion in a case where clandestine, unauthorized loans were made to Iraq, with much of the money being for nuclear, chemical and ballistic weapons projects. In the Clinton Whitewater affair, Webster Hubbell pleaded guilty to mail fraud and tax evasion for overbilling clients."]}
{"id": "D0646A", "query": "What is the definition of perjury? Is it a federal offense? How common is it and what kinds of punishments have been given?", "summaries": ["Perjury is lying under oath. Under federal law, prosecutors must prove the person knows the statement is inaccurate, intends to make a false statement, and that the lies are material to the case at hand. In 1973 the US Supreme Court said that shrewd or narrow answers calculated to evade are not perjury as long as they are truthful. Perjury is a crime on both local and federal levels. Federal law also prohibits making false statements on federal forms or to federal officers. Perjury cases account for less than 1 percent of federal prosecutions and less than 10 percent of state prosecutions. Perjury charges usually arise in conjunction with other crimes and are brought in civil cases far less frequently than in criminal cases. Most perjury cases involve documents. Federal perjury prosecutions average 130 per year. In October 1998, 115 people were serving sentences for perjury in federal prisons. Under federal law perjury and false statements are punishable by an undetermined fine, up to five years in prison or both. Federal sentences average 27 months. Other perjury punishments have involved home detention, community service, giving up a medical license, removal from public office, and prison sentences of 60 days, four months, and two years. In the O.J. Simpson case Mark Fuhrman was charged with three years probation and fined $200. Perjury convictions brought prison sentences of three years to Alger Hiss and six years in a terrorism case and for a confessed killer earlier cleared of his crime.", "Perjury is a false statement knowingly made in a court proceeding about some matter material to the issue or point in question. The prosecution must demonstrate that a person knew that the statement was inaccurate and intended to make a false statement. A 1972 Supreme Court decision made it clear that an unresponsive or misleading statement, even a half-truth, is not enough for conviction. Perjury is a both a criminal and civil federal offense, but perjury convictions are more prevalent in state courts. From 1992 to 1998 there were 700 federal perjury prosecutions and 16,000 perjury prosecutions in California. In 1997 federal perjury cases were.1% of the total prosecutions and California perjury prosecutions were 1%. Perjury convictions often accompany other charges or are pursued because other suspected crimes cannot be prosecuted successfully. For example, Alger Hiss, a suspected spy, served 3 years for perjury. Federal punishment is a fine, prison for up to 5 years, or both. Actual sentences have range from public service to 60 days to 5 years in jail. In 1997 the average sentence for a federal conviction was 27 months. Two federal judges have been impeached and removed from office for lying. A British politician was completely ruined for lying and a British killer, initially found not guilty but who later confessed, received 6 years for lying. President Clinton was impeached but not convicted by Congress, but was later convicted in civil court. He had to pay court costs and faced disbarment .", "Black's Law Dictionary defines perjury as \"a false statement knowingly made\" in a court proceeding about \"some matter material to the issue or point in question\". A 1972 U.S. Supreme Court case found that an unresponsive or misleading statement or even a half-truth is not enough to convict someone of perjury. In the 1973 case, Bronston vs. U.S., the U.S. Supreme Court laid down the prevailing rule that even statements under oath that were \"shrewdly calculated to evade\" were not sufficient to convict for perjury. Separate from perjury under oath in federal trials or proceedings, federal law also prohibits making unsworn but false statements on federal forms or to federal officers. In 1977, perjury cases were less that 10% of state prosecutions and less than 1% of federal prosecutions. Of 49,655 federal cases in 1997, 139 were for perjury. There were on average 130 federal perjury cases per year. State information is sketchy, but by way of example, in 1997 in California there were 4,318 felony perjury cases among 326,768 total cases. In 1997 in New York there were 395 perjury cases. A federal conviction of perjury carries a maximum five-year sentence. In 1997, the average federal perjury conviction was 27 months. In 1997, there were 115 perjurers in federal prison. Example perjury sentences range from four months to nearly six years in prison; 6 months home detention; probation; 3 years supervised release; and fines of $200 to $6,144. Perjured federal judges have been impeached and removed from office.", "Perjury is lying under oath. Under federal law, knowledge and intent are requirements; the person must know the statement is inaccurate and must intend to make that false statement. Also, the testimony must be material to the case. Judge Gerald Tjoflat wrote, \"perjury, regardless of the setting, is a serious offense that results in incalculable harm to the functioning and integrity of the legal system\". Perjury is a highly technical crime that requires such an airtight case that prosecutors rarely pursue it. A narrow or evasive answer is not necessarily perjury. A Department of Justice statistician says the federal government undertakes about 130 prosecutions per year. In 1997, of 49,655 cases filed by federal prosecutors only 87 were for perjury. State courts show higher figures, with over 4000 perjury cases in California alone. Interviews with legal experts suggest the threat of prosecution is a crucial deterrent to perjury. Sentences generally range from home confinement to months in jail. Judges who were convicted have been removed from office. A police figure in a murder case pleaded no contest and was sentenced to three years' probation. A postal supervisor lied about a sexual relationship and is in prison for 13 months. A Texas youth went to jail for 60 days for lying that his rights were not read. A KKK received home detention and community service but a federal appeals court sent the case back for a stiffer sentence! A US president had to pay his accuser's legal fees."]}

What are native German's reaction to immigrants and asylum seekers?", "summaries": ["Historically, Germany has not been able to integrate foreigners and this continued in 1992. At that time, six million were living and working, in jobs Germans did not want, in Germany. The naturalization process was onerous with only ethnic Germans having any real chance of gaining full citizenship. There also was a flood of refugees seeking asylum and crossing the borders faster than 1 a minute. The 1948 constitution had granted all political refugees entry and a hearing to determine whether they would be granted asylum. In 1992 less than 5% were allowed to stay but the process was long and they were billeted in hostels financed and operated by the German states. Many disappeared from the hostels and public opinion, sparked by media headlines, was blaming them for the rising crime, unemployment, housing shortages, and social security fraud. They were becoming the scapegoat for reunifications failures. Neo-Nazi gangs were attacking foreigners in the hostels and elsewhere. There were 4,587 attacks by December 12. People were killed; bombs and fires were used. While the majority of Germans were against and embarrassed by these attacks and a few demonstrated against the Nazis, some \"regular people\" stood by and cheered during them. A survey of young (ages 16-24) Germans, found 1/3 were hostile toward foreigners or had xenophobic thoughts. One quarter rejected all forms of discriminations. Another survey found 25% wanted foreigners repatriated and 50% agreed, \"Germany belongs to Germans.\" By December politicians were seeking ways to decrease refugee entries.", "Germany, now the richest country in Europe, developed a reputation for being \"foreigner-friendly\". As of 1992, there were 6m foreigners living and working in Germany. Many, like the Turks and Kurds, were encouraged to come to Germany to shore up a decreasing labor force caused by diminishing ethnic German population. Foreigners were also enticed by Germany's official policy of accepting asylum-seekers fleeing from prosecution -- mostly from the distressed areas of the former eastern block and the 3rd world. 256,112 foreigners entered Germany in 1991, some 33% more than in 1990. However, this massive influx of foreigners during 1991-92 has seriously exacerbated social tensions throughout Germany; namely, in the form of over 2,000 attacks against asylum-seekers by young neo-Nazi gangs and right-wing sympathizers. Currently, one out of three young German adults admit being hostile toward foreigners. In effect, most asylum-seekers are migrants seeking a higher life style. They are gathered in large camps and processing them usually takes months. The cost of supporting them is straining the resources of the state and local government administrations as the country faces overwhelming costs in the unification with economically drained Eastern Germany. This situation has caused friction in Germany's top political parties as the Government strives to resolve the problem. Police protection has been stepped up and changes in the German constitution are being proposed to stop unqualified asylum applicants at the borders, provide financial assistance for all migrants sent back to a third country, and speed up the citizenship process.", "Germany's constitution provides that persons persecuted on political grounds shall have the right to asylum in Germany. Anyone seeking asylum is allowed in, housed and fed pending determination of the validity of his claim of political persecution. Fewer than five percent are approved; most are found to be economic refugees seeking a better life in Europe's wealthiest country. Most of those arriving in Germany come from Yugoslavia, Romania (mostly Gypsies), Turkey, Bulgaria, and Vietnam. Attacks on hostels for refugees awaiting resolution of their claims have occurred in several parts of the country, but particularly in the northern city of Rostock. The violent attacks are mostly by neo-Nazi groups and are denounced by the majority of Germans. However, when surveyed, nearly a third of young Germans admit being hostile to foreigners. A broad sampling of Germans agreed with the statement \"Germany belongs to the Germans\". Legislation has been introduced in the German parliament to curb the influx of foreigners and to allow sending \"manifestly unfound cases\" to a third country bordering on Germany. Ethnic Germans who reside outside of Germany have a constitutional right to return to Germany; however, the German government is campaigning to persuade the nearly two million Volga Germans to remain in Russia. Obtaining German citizenship is largely a question of German blood. The path to German citizenship is tortuous even for one married to a German or born in Germany of non-German parents.", "Among causes for lack of integration of foreigners in Germany is racial bias. People with dark skins are perceived blamed for crime and irresponsible behavior. For example, families of Roma gypsies are accused of pestering passers-by, begging, and stealing from shops. People in east Germany, who face immense social and economic changes following German unification, are under extreme pressure. Unemployment is high, and defenseless foreigners are clearly easy targets, especially since it's known that most asylum-seekers are not political but economic refugees. To many in the east, frightened about their own future, foreigners are scapegoats upon whom most of their ills can be blamed. A more basic cause may be the uncontrolled flow of asylum-seekers into Germany. The German constitution offers asylum to the persecuted. In practice, anyone asking for asylum at the border is allowed in. After examination, fewer than 5% of applicants are approved. In 1992, almost six million foreigners were living and working in the federal republic. An upsurge in numbers in 1992 has exerted unmanageable pressures on local budgets and generated riots and attacks on foreigners--exacerbated by hard-core neo-Nazis. Political pressure grows for a change in the German constitution that would tighten controls on immigration. But there is a growing consensus that what Germany really needs is an immigration law. Under current regulations it is extremely difficult for immigrants to obtain German citizenship. Many legal experts believe that without that possibility there is little chance of integrating foreigners into German society."]}

One of the earliest and longest standing decisions of the ICJ involved the Corfu Channel incident in 1946 when two British destroyers struck Albanian-laid mines while exercising their right of passage through Corfu Channel. One was sunk with loss of 44 lives and the other scuttled. The ICJ ruled in 1948 that Albania should pay Britain 843,947 pounds. Albania paid up 1.1 million pounds in May 1992. The ICJ has settled Border disputes. A 20-year dispute between Libya and Chad was settled in Chad's favor in 1994. A 23-year dispute between Honduras and El Salvador was settled by a compromise devised by the ICJ in 1992. On the other hand, the ICJ ordered Serbia and Bosnia to cease committing genocide in 1993 without effect. In 1951 a company, British Petroleum, sued Iran before the ICJ over the nationalization of all foreign oil interests in Iran.

The court heard mutual Serbian and Bosnian accusations, and ordered both to stop genocide and ethnic cleansing. The court resolved border disputes between Chad and Libya, and Honduras and El Salvador. The court overruled a 1960 U.N. resolution refuting South African control over Namibia, and reversed itself in 1967. Libya asked the court to make Britain and the U.S. hand over evidence incriminating Libya in airliner bombings over Scotland and Niger. It rejected Libya's requested injunction against Britain and the U.S. \"taking any action against Libya calculated to coerce or compel Libya to surrender the accused individuals to any jurisdiction outside of Libya\", and endorsed U.N. sanctions against Libya. The court heard a case by British Petroleum against Iran's nationalization of all foreign oil interests in 1951. In 1989 Iran asked the court to declare unlawful the 1988 U.S. shoot-down of Iran Air 655 and make the U.S. compensate Iran directly, not individual Iranians.

The World Court has pronounced judgments on border disputes between Honduras and El Salvador and between Chad and Libya. The Court ruled that Albania should compensate Britain for a destroyer sunk in the Corfu Channel shortly after the end of World War II.

The Court found the US guilty of violating international law when it mined the harbors in Nicaragua. In the case of two Libyans accused of blowing up a Pan Am flight over Scotland, the US and Britain wanted Libya to turn the suspects over to them. Libya claimed it had the right to try them and asked the court to restrain the US and Britain from using force or imposing sanctions against Libya for failing to turn over suspects. A second type of case involves violations of international conventions, such as genocide and war crimes. The Court considered the claim by Bosnia that Serb carried out a campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide against them. They also considered a similar claim by Serbia of genocide carried out by Moslems. A third type concerns interpretations of treaties and accords. Portugal, the recognized administrator of East Timor, challenged Australia's accord with Indonesia in the Court over waters south of Timor. Additional types of cases are territorial disputes, such as South Africa's control over Namibia; border disputes, such as between Hondoras and El Salvador; and reparation cases, such as Iran's request for compensation from the US for downing an Iranian Airbus with a missile.", "The International or World Court located in The Hague, Netherlands is made up of 15 permanent judges plus two others nominated by the parties involved in a dispute.

The court also considered reciprocal Bosnian-Serbian accusations of genocide. It ruled on border disputes between Honduras and El Salvador and between Chad and Libya. It ordered Albania to compensate Britain for losses when British destroyers struck Albanian-laid mines in the Corfu Channel, heard Iran's suit that the US compensate Iran for an Iranian airliner mistakenly shot down by the US, and heard British Petroleum's arguments when Iran's Massadeq nationalized foreign oil interests. It heard Portugal's challenge of Australia's right to enter an accord with Indonesia over Timor. It overruled a UN resolution condemning South African control over Namibia but reversed itself 7 years later. It heard US appeals for release of hostages held by Iran. It heard Nicaragua's claim that the US illegally aided the Contras and condemned the US embargo and harbor-mining of Nicaragua, prompting the US to walk out in protest.", "The World Court, or International Court of Justice in The Hague, is made up of 15 permanent judges, plus a further two nominated by the parties involved in a case. It hears cases involving international disputes. Although, it does not have powers to enforce its orders, its decisions have traditionally carried some diplomatic weight. The types of cases it hears would include disputes over jurisdiction or extradition of criminal suspects, such as two Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing. Another type would be cases of long-standing border disputes over which wars may have been fought. The World Court hears cases about embargoes imposed by one country against another, and disagreements over territorial ocean waters. It hears cases involving questions of sovereignty, illegal mining of harbor waters, and illegal nationalization of foreign oil interests. Many cases which come before the World Court involve accidents of war, such as the post-World War II Corfu Channel incident in 1948 and the 1988 Iran Air Flight 655 incident in the Strait of Hormuz. The World Court considered accusations from both sides fighting in the former Yugoslavia since 1991. It ordered both Bosnia and Serbia to stop acts of genocide. The UN Security Council convened an International War Crimes Tribunal to be held at The Hague, where the International Court of Justice is located. The UN-sponsored tribunal to deal with war crimes committed by Serbia and Bosnia was sworn in for a four-year period.", "The International Court of Justice at The Hague, acts as a world court. It issues rulings on international law disputes submitted to it by any state. It is made up of fifteen permanent judges, plus two more nominated by the parties involved. It does not have any powers to enforce its orders, although its decisions have traditionally carried some diplomatic weight. Its rulings sometimes fuel wider diplomatic debates. The Court may also appoint an independent tribunal such as the international war crimes tribunal in 1991, charged with attempting to prosecute perpetrators of murder, rape, and enforced expulsions in former Yugoslavia. Eleven judges of the tribunal were sworn in at the International Court of Justice. The types of international law cases heard by the Court are varied. Libya appealed unsuccessfully to the Court to halt Britain and US demands for punitive action and extradition of the Libyans alleged to have carried out the 1998 bombing of a Pan Am transport over Lockerbie, Scotland. The Court persuaded Britain and Albania to settle long standing diplomatic and legal disputes over the loss of two destroyers and 44 lives when Albanian-laid mines struck the ships. It has also ruled on disputes over borders and territorial waters, citizenship rights, the placement of embargoes, and the liability of a state using its military facilities to attack another state's commercial aircraft. The Court allowed British Petroleum to argue its case when Iran nationalized foreign oil interests and overruled a UN decision declaring Namibia under South African control.", "The World Court, also known as the International Court of Justice, is headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands. Sixteen permanent judges preside in the Peace Palace. The Court does not have the powers to enforce its decisions, but they usually carry diplomatic weight. In the early 1990's, the Court also hosted the UN sponsored international war crimes tribunal, trying those accused of murder and other atrocities in the former Yugoslavia. The Court hears cases involving disagreements between and among nations. Military disputes are very common cases. Albania was fined when British destroyers hit Albanian mines in the Corfu Channel in 1948. Iran tried to sue the US for downing an Iranian airliner with a missile in 1988. The court has settle border disputes, including the El Salvador-Honduras dispute begun in 1969 and a 20-year dispute between Chad and Libya. Actions by world powers against smaller nations also have been tried. These include USSR embargos against Lithuania and US support of the Contras, including mining Nicaraguan harbors. They also hear disagreements over rightful leadership such as who should head Namibia in 1960, the legal administration of Timor in the early 1990's, and Bosnian claims of Serbian annexation attempts in 1993. They did not accept a case on the coup against Noriega of Panama in 1989. Other notable cases include the Iranian nationalization of foreign oil interests in 1951, the US petition for release of the embassy hostages in Iran, and Libyan efforts to circumvent prosecutions of Libyan airline bombers in the mid-1980's."]}

Mongolia's relationship with bordering neighbors China and Russia must be maintained at an appropriate level. Sino-Mongolian relations were normalized in 1989, and since then the two countries have worked to strengthen ties and develop economic and trade cooperation in the interest of regional peace and stability. China supports Mongolia as a nuclear-free zone. China pledges to abide by the principles of peaceful co-existence and the treaty on Sino-Mongolian friendship and cooperation. Russia has stated that economic and trade problems between Russia and Mongolia will be resolved and that there are no major conflicts between the two countries. Mongolia is in the process of transforming from a central-planning economy to a market oriented-economy and requires technical and monetary aid for the restructuring and to help improve the living conditions of the country's poor. Mongolia ranks among the five most foreign assisted countries of the world. Japan is the main provider of aid to Mongolia. Aid also comes from the US, China, European countries (Britain, France, Denmark and Germany), Canada, Kuwait and from the World Bank, United Nations and the Asian Development Bank. Mongolia decided to apply to join the World Trade Organization and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.", "Mongolia's foreign policy has focused on friendly relations with China and Russia. After China and Mongolia normalized relations in 1989, expanded trade and repeated declarations of friendship followed. Mongolia pledged an open policy of non-alignment and adherence to a \"one China\" policy. China agreed to economic and technological cooperation. Mongolia emphasized the importance of friendly relations with Russia and avoided any open clashes, but gained little in the form of aid from Russia. Japan helped organize a series of international meetings which by 1999 had contributed $2 billion U.S. to Mongolia. Japan was the largest contributor providing 1/3 of the total. In 1996 France and Britain praised Mongolia's market-oriented reforms and pledged humanitarian aid. The United States and Mongolia established diplomatic ties in 1987 and by 1997 Mongolia had received $70 million U.S. in aid. In 1997 Canada promised to provide aid and set up an honorary Consulate in Ulan Bator to promote economic and trade relations with Mongolia. Denmark started economic aid to Mongolia in 1991, contributing $27 million U.S. during the period 1991-97. The President of Mongolia paid an official visit to Kuwait in March 1998 to promote relations, particularly in economic fields. In September 1998 the Mongolian President called for help from Germany in developing relations with the European Union and NATO. The two countries signed an agreement under which Germany would provide $25 million marks in aid. German-Mongolian bilateral trade in 1997 was 6.2 times the level of 1993.", "During the 1990s, the government of Mongolia made a concerted effort to create political and economic ties with the world, and in particular the Asian-Pacific region. In 1996 it applied to join the World Trade Organization and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Of major importance, was establishing and maintaining ties with its neighbors, China and Russia, both of whom contributed economic aid to the impoverished country. China, recognizing the need for a stable neighbor, has pledged long term friendship and cooperation with Mongolia. Tensions rose, but were settled between Russia and Mongolia when the latter had difficulty repaying a loan. Mongolia's main goals are to reduce unemployment and poverty by stabilizing the economy and revitalizing national industry. Mongolia has established relations with many European nations. France and Britain pledged financial support to Mongolia in exchange for a promise to transform their economy from central-planning to market-oriented. France's assistance will be put toward hydro-power and environmental protection. Denmark offered its cooperation with Mongolia in the fields of energy, communications, environment protection, agriculture, and livestock husbandry. Mongolia has asked for Germany's support in developing relations with the European Union and NATO. The two countries are trading partners. Canada and the US have also given financial aid to Mongolia. Both countries back Mongolia's efforts to join international organizations and agree to expand political, economic, scientific, and cultural cooperation. Japan is the largest financial contributor and supporter of Mongolia, organizing six international meeting with the World Bank to obtain money for the country's development.", "Mongolia is among five of the most foreign-assisted countries in the world. It is seriously conducting ongoing economic and political reforms to transform its centrally planned economy into a market-oriented one. Its biggest obstacle is poverty, compelling Mongolia to depend heavily on foreign loans and economic aid. Many countries, encouraged by Mongolia's open foreign policy of non-alignment, its status as a nuclear-free state, and its rich natural resources, have responded with financial, technical and economic aid. In June 1999, some twenty countries and eight international organizations collectively pledged $320 million in loans. About 45 percent of its annual investment and budget depends on such support. Japan is the largest donor nation for Mongolia accounting for one-third of the $1.484 billion in aid and loans. China and Mongolia are making substantial progress in bilateral relations with both sides, reiterating long-term commitment to friendship and cooperation. Mongolia is focusing on political and economic ties in Northeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific Region. The US has committed to political and economic ties with Mongolia, especially in the field of environment protection. So far, the US has sent $70 million in economic and technical aid, and has signed an agreement on military exchanges and cooperation. Denmark is increasing its aid with a $27 million grant. France has presented a grant of $3.5 million for hydropower and environmental protection projects. Kuwait is building a road in Mongolia valued at $59.4 million.

The Warsaw Pact will reduce its European arsenals by 40%, NATO by 3%, for equal arms ceilings. Both keep in Central Europe 20,000 battle tanks, 30,000 armored vehicles, 20,000 artillery, 6,800 combat planes and 2,000 attack helicopters -- about half current stocks. They have 40 months to destroy excesses. Combined East and West German troops go from 600,000 to 370,000. A separate declaration limits Soviet land-based naval aircraft. Broader troop talks are to begin. The first U.S.-Soviet arms control treaty, in 1963, banned nuclear tests in the atmosphere, oceans and space. In 1972, the first Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty established ceilings on long-range nuclear missiles and bombers higher than either's arsenal -- legalizing further buildup. In 1979 SALT II reduced USSR missiles, but spawned a quadrupling of unrestricted multiple nuclear warheads. Initialed in June 1990, for signing in early 1991, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty limited strategic nuclear warheads and platforms. Side agreements limited chemical weapons and nuclear testing. START limits both sides to 6,000 nuclear warheads; a maximum of 4,900 on ballistic missiles -- the rest on air-launched cruise missiles (ALCM) and bombers; no more than 3,300 on land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and no more than 1,540 on Soviet very large (\"heavy\") ICBMs. Sea-launched cruise missiles remain unresolved. START II talks begin in early 1991.", "The Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty provides for the Soviet Union and its former East European allies to reduce conventional weapons by 40% and for NATO countries to cut its European forces by 3%. This treaty is the largest negotiated arms reduction in history. The biggest cuts will be made by Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. Germany became the first European nation to begin destroying its cold war arsenal. Weapons that will be destroyed or removed from Europe include tanks, artillery, helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, chemical weapons, and armored vehicles. Some of the conventional NATO weapons can be moved from central Europe to smaller NATO countries. The Soviet Union agreed to remove tactical nuclear weaponry from Europe. Russia has moved some conventional weapons marked for destruction to locations east of the Urals and out the area covered by CFE. Hungary has destroyed over 500 old tanks under CFE. The START treaty addresses the reduction of strategic, nuclear arms. START would cut by half the number of offensive nuclear missiles in the superpower arsenals. The US and Soviet Union had agreed to limit each to 6000 nuclear weapons. Strategic weapons systems include intercontinental ballistic missiles, air launched cruise missiles, mobile land-based missiles and long range bombers. Ukraine has a large number of intercontinental ballistic missiles and bases for long-range nuclear armed bombers but has promised to become non-nuclear.", "Arms control was central to U.S.-Soviet relations for a generation, but little headway was made until 1988 when Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) negotiations began. The treaty, signed in 1990, provided for the Soviet Union and its former East European allies to slash their European arsenals by 40%, and for NATO to cut its forces by 3%. Each alliance was limited to 20,000 tanks, 30,000 armored cars, 20,000 artillery pieces, 6,800 combat aircraft and 2,000 attack helicopters. Troop-levels were subject to further negotiations. In June, 1992, the successor states to the Soviet Union agreed on a share-out of the weapons cuts to which Moscow had committed itself in the CFE. The five other members of the defunct Warsaw Pact had already ratified the CFE pact. The CFE treaty was designed to balance two blocs, one of which disintegrated. That left enormous disparities. Belarus has twice as many tanks as Britain, more big guns than France, more combat aircraft than Germany. Even after CFE cuts, Ukraine will have the third largest number of tanks and armored vehicles in Europe and the second largest number of artillery and aircraft. By 1994 all the former Warsaw pact countries are reducing the overall level of forces and shifting units away from western deployment. But progress is slow. Cuts promised by Russia for the end of the decade include a 45% reduction in troop numbers, but even then, Russia will still have an army of 1.5 million, leaving former Warsaw pact nations wary.", "The Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, signed in 1990, called for the WP to slash its arsenals by 40% and for NATO to cut its European forces by 3% to comply with equal arms ceilings on both sides. This equates to a total for both sides mutually: 3,400 aircraft, 20,000 tanks, 2,000 helicopters, 28,000 personnel carriers, and from 16,500 to 24,000 artillery pieces. The deadline for implementation of the treaty is 1995, including a 45% reduction in current troop numbers. Regional cuts began in Europe shortly after August 1992 when Germany because the first European country to start destroying its cold war arsenal. Implementing the cuts is an awesome problem for central and eastern European countries. Cutting up tanks is expensive and environmentally hazardous. Hungary destroyed 510 older tanks in 1993 but simultaneously began upgrading its arsenal with weapons from Russia out of concern about the forming of new states in Eastern Europe. Russian, Ukraine and other newly independent states agree to share-out the Soviet Union's arms cuts and enforce reductions of heavy army weapons and aircraft. The goal of the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks treaty is to reduce the arsenal of each superpower below 6,000 warheads by 1998. For the US, this means 11,974 to 5907 warheads and 11,320 to 5,983 warheads for Russia. Ukraine has stated it will destroy all 176 of its launch silos within seven years. Of the 6,000 offensive nuclear weapons permitted under START, no more than 4,900 can be warheads on ballistic missiles."]}

What were their perceived habits, preferences, characteristics, and impact?", "summaries": ["In the 1990's Gen X was a fashionable synonym for the twentysomethings, post Baby-Boomers, born from 1965-1979, and complete with an entire set of stereotypes. Many Gen Xers know the only reason they are in this world is that their yuppy parents had money and they are just another possession. Then they were deserted by divorcing parents and discredited social institutions. With no rules left to break and everything up for grabs, they have no clear sense of identity. Alienated and isolated, they have become cynical. They linger in school, put off marriage, and flit from job to job. They want eternal adolescence: \"Adulthood Lite\". They worry about commitment -- but long to nurture -- babies, pets, even robotic pets! They shun churches but love spirituality. Indifferent to politics, they rarely vote, but are big on volunteering. Gen Xers are not intimidated by authority. Instead, they are quick to question policies and practices they are uncomfortable with. However, they have little regard for experience and \"working one's way up\". They are creative and comfortable with technology, having grown up intimately linked to media culture -- Internet, TV, film, music. They are capable of handling change and find it easy to transfer loyalty to whatever job/project they're working on at the moment. With their independent can-do attitudes and creativity they may be the ones to get things done! Thus the Gen Xers are not just the latte-scarfing slackers they are often perceived as. Pinning labels on groups is convenient but dangerous!", "\"Generation X\" refers to people born roughly from 1961 to 1981 who grew up heavily influenced by media culture: Internet, television, film and music. Influenced by an era of technology, television, day care, divorce and downsizing, they are skeptical and impatient with the status quo. It is said that Pop culture is where they find meaning in life. They are described as fiercely independent, brash, audacious and arrogant, thriving on change and with a disdain for authority. With high technological skills and subject to less economic security than their parents, they tend to move from job to job and like to feel that they are in the driver's seat. Their loyalty is to the project of the moment. For the most part they are very libertarian having low expectations of political parties, politics in general, government, corporations and institutions, believing in the power of the individual. They tend not to vote, even for President. Some observers see Generation X as basically religious although suspicious of religious institutions. They can relate to the Dali Lama and are looking for something or someone to nurture and love. Generation X women reaching their 30's show interest in motherhood fully recognizing the challenge of being a good parent. Generation X feels alienated and isolated but confident in its ability to accomplish the job at hand. They have offered technological skills and new ideas to the economy, but have been a challenge to management.", "Generation X describes the generation following the post World War II baby boom, born in the mid 1960's to late 1990's. The term \"Generation X\" was popularized by a 1991 novel with that name by Douglas Coupland. Gen Xers grew up with television and personal computers, and were influenced by daycare, divorce, downsizing, inflation, and recession. They grew up without illusions, and were alienated and isolated, with a cynical belief that they were on their own. They would have far less job security than their parents had. They became impatient and skeptical, and had a disdain for authority. They often did not vote. They lingered in school, often putting off marriage, and flitted from job to job. There was a perception that they were unmotivated and underemployed \"slackers\" who prefer whining about societal problems than fixing them. In the workplace, they concentrated on building individual skills, especially those related to computers, and expected to move easily from job to job. They were recognized as being bold, perceptive, confident, and demanding employees who worked hard and played hard. Despite being called slackers, they were credited with starting new businesses and the resulting dot-com boom. They had an intimate link with media culture -- the Internet, television, film, and music. They relied on the Internet before buying a car and preferred compact and midsize cars. They had nostalgia for old things from the 1970's to the early 1990's. They were influential in popular culture during the 1980s and 1990s, especially rock music.", "Generation Xers were born from 1965 to as late as 1981. They are the latchkey children of divorced \"baby boomer\", into technology, and sharing a worldwide pop culture. They are described as cautious or brash, independent and isolated yet needy, cynical self-starters who are good with change but distain authority. By the mid 1990's they were becoming a force in the workplace, at times in conflict with the older workers. Although both groups wanted the same general managerial environment, the Gen Xers demanded it. They needed different training and frequent feedback and expected to change jobs often. They were delaying marriage and women began to feel they didn't want everything like their mothers had. Babies were the new status symbol. Gen Xers feared rising taxes to support the aging boomers. They were beginning to save for retirement early, but choosing conservative investments. They found politics boring and generally didn't align with political parties. They were more likely to volunteer than vote. Some continued to join the Peace Corps and the wealthier were getting into philanthropy. Their suspicions of institutions carried over churches, but some clergy considered them spiritual and the Dalai Lama and Pope John Paul II were popular. In the market, they wanted digital video recorders and cameras, online money, and retro fashions from Goodwill. Most preferred foreign smaller automobiles such as the Honda Civic, but automakers were in hot pursuit with Neons, PT Cruisers, and the Xterra.

Are they endangered by the type of situations they are covering or by the content of their reports?", "summaries": ["Journalism has always been a dangerous profession. In 1989, for example, sixty-three journalists were killed on the job in 22 countries. In the first three months of 1990, journalists were killed in El Salvador, Brazil, Romania, and Turkey. Proportionally, more journalists were killed in Viet Nam than American soldiers. Now the danger for many journalists comes not just from being at the scene of battle, but because their reporting challenges authority, investigates crime and drug rings, and government corruption. These journalists see their jobs as exposing the misuse of wealth and power. Foreign correspondents have been kidnapped in China and Sri Lanka not only from the scene being reported but even from their homes. Some have later been freed and had been treated well in captivity. Others were later found murdered. Other reporters, such as those covering the protests in Tainanmen Square in China, have been beaten, kicked and harassed, and made to disperse at gunpoint. Women reporters and the wives of correspondents have also been beaten and harassed. Chinese reporters were threatened and jailed by the police unless they printed only the official line of the Communist government. Most eventually did what the government asked. A reporter in Columbia who crusaded against the drug cartel was shot to death in his parents home. Mexican journalists were killed pursuing stories of government corruption and drug trafficking.", "Journalism is an increasingly dangerous profession. Journalists of today are bold and insist on asking tough questions and challenging authority whenever it appears to be abusive. Sometimes they are endangered accidentally by the situations they cover, such as those arrested covering a rock concert riot, and those whose car burst into flames while driving past a burning oilfield in Kuwait. More often they are at risk because they plunge into situations of political conflict and unrest and crusade against political corruption and oppression. Covering political unrest or wars, journalists are often caught in the crossfire of the fighting. However, they are more often targeted by one or another side of a conflict. Numerous journalists have been killed, wounded or kidnapped by opposition forces in dozens of countries. In the Middle East, journalists have been targeted by extremist groups who kill some, and hold others hostage in an attempt to force government action. Journalists often fall victim to the repressive regimes they crusade against. They have been executed as spies, unlawfully detained, and beaten. Some are attacked to intimidate other journalists. They have suffered retaliation for their parts in uprisings, been exiled, jailed, forced to recant, and denied their jobs. Even émigré journalists have been attacked for their muckraking publications abroad. Journalists have been victimized for pursuing stories of official corruption, drug trafficking, and mafia activities. Not only have drug traffickers and cartels targeted journalists, but public officials who fear exposure of their connections to them have, as well.", "Journalists may face a variety of dangers in their work. When deployed to an area of active warfare, whether between nations or factions within a nation, they are unlikely to be personally targeted but in reporting on the battle in progress they subject themselves to danger of kidnapping, capture, torture, wounding or death. Examples are media coverage of Romania 1989, Sri Lanka 1989-90, the Gulf War in 1991, Bosnia 1992-93, and Somalia and Haiti in 1993. On the other hand, when the journalist's beat is a nation, state or region governed by autocratic or corrupt government or under the influence of powerful criminal elements, the journalist's truthful reporting puts him in danger of arrest, beating, imprisonment, assassination or execution. Examples are reporters covering Egypt under Mubarak, China 1989-90, Mexico with its corrupt officials and drug lords 1989-90, Iraq under Saddam Hussein in 1990, Iran in 1992, Peronist Argentina in 1994, and the Mafia in Italy and Russia 1993-94. If the truth hurts the journalist may be in danger. Journalists covering the Vietnam War suffered a higher proportionate casualty rate than soldiers, certainly because of the situation in which they found themselves. But the 19 journalists murdered in Colombia in 1989 and the 56 arrested in China that year were targeted because of what they wrote or might write.", "Journalism is a dangerous profession. Journalists have been murdered, killed in other ways, kidnapped, arrested, imprisoned, tortured, threatened, and banished. Journalists in war and riot zones are subject to the life-threatening dangers as are the warriors and those attempting to quell riots. In attempting to report the news, they have been victims in nearly all parts of the world but mostly in war zones, where governments suppress opposition, or where there is no established law and order. Some governments target journalists whose reporting is contrary, or even hostile, to that government's programs or actions. Drug cartels, groups attempting to overthrow a government, guerilla bands, criminal activities, e.g., the Mafia have kidnapped and murdered journalists for their expose activity or for merely witnessing activity intended to be unrevealed. The number of journalists killed was on the increase during the latter half of the 1980s. The existence of the \"Committee to Protect Journalists\" testifies to the recognition that journalism is a dangerous profession."]}

During the period 1889-1993 such mercy killings ended the lives of Tanya Marie Rivera, Gema Marie Huber, Karen Eickholdt, Estelle Browning, David Heffer, Tony Bank and Nancy Gamble. Less typical cases include 35 patients killed by three nurses in a Vienna, Austria hospital apparently in a misguided sense of mercy. The nurses were charged in 1989. The same year Rudolfo Linares visited his 15-month-old comatose son in the hospital, pulled a gun on a nurse and removed his son's respirator. In 1990 there was a series of mercy killings. Janet Atkins pushed a button on a death machine provided by Dr. Jack Kevorkian to end her life. In another case of assisted suicide the husband of Virginia Harper, an advanced cancer patient, suffocated his wife after her attempt at suicide had failed. Steven Charles Jenkins, terminally ill with AIDS, was shot by his friend Philip Lee Sayor in the hospital and Delbert Ward suffocated his brother William who had multiple tumors and \"wasn't doing too good\". Eighty-one-year old Roswell Gilbert shot his 72-year old wife who had Alzheimer's and osteoporosis, claiming it a mercy killing. Dr. Dan Cox who administered a \"heart stopper\" to a terminally ill patient in 1992 was convicted in 1993.", "In 1989 in Chicago, Rudolfo Linares held a nurse at gun point and then disconnected the respirator from his 15-month old, terminally ill son, comatose for several months from asphyxiation brain damage after swallowing a balloon. A few months earlier he had been thwarted from attempting to disconnect the respirator. In 1990 Steven Jenkins, a terminally ill AIDS patient at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center was fatally shot by his friend Philip Saylor in California. In 1990 in New York, small farmer Delbert Ward, 59, told authorities that he smothered his brother, Bill, 64, in his sleep, as a \"mercy killing\". Another brother, 70, confirmed that Bill had been seriously ill, barely able to work on the farm, after a chain-saw injury to his jaw. Bill's autopsy revealed a benign, soft-ball sized tumor in his neck. He had kidney and prostate tumors that might have been cancerous. In 1990 in Detroit, Bertram Harper, according to an agreement with his wife, secured a plastic bag over her head, allowing her to suffocate, after the dose of sleeping pills she took while holding hands with her husband and daughter didn't kill her. She was in excruciating pain from advanced terminal cancer and had asked her family to help her end her life. The prosecutor called it a \"mercy killing\". In 1993 British doctor Alan Cox gave a lethal, heart-stopping drug injection to end an elderly patient with chronic pain.", "People who died as the result of mercy killings, including those who died as a result of doctor-assisted suicide, suffered a broad spectrum of conditions prior to their deaths. Some were suffering from a severely deteriorated quality of life and others were terminally ill or in irreversible comatose states. Those suffering from a deteriorated quality of life include the elderly, quadriplegics, those paralyzed by the incurable Lou Gehrig's disease, and those afflicted with Alzheimer's disease and fearing further mental deterioration. These victims often sought the right to die. Those terminally ill often suffered from cancer or AIDS, or were victims of severe injuries. Those in comatose states include injury victims, victims of gunshot and stabbing wounds, disaster victims, and victims of severe physical abuse; there are cases of comatose states being induced by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, drinking a cocaine-laced soft drink, and swallowing a balloon. The principals performing mercy killings and their methods varied considerably. They include hospital staff turning off life-support systems; physicians and nurses administering lethal injections; Dr. Kevorkian supplying patients with a device containing lethal drugs for use in committing suicide; a friend fatally shooting an AIDS patient; a brother smothering his ill brother; a husband shooting his wife who suffered from Alzheimer's disease; and a husband suffocating his wife who suffered from cancer. There are cases of self-anointed \"angels of death\" giving lethal injections to hospital patients who were not necessarily terminally ill or who had not expressed a right to die.", "Mercy killings have taken place in a variety of settings and by different methods. Removing life support from long-comatose patients, however, is not usually considered mercy killing. Three nurses in a Vienna hospital were arrested in1989, under suspicion of killing up to 35 patients with drug overdoses. In 1989, a West German nurse was sentenced to 11 years in prison for killing patients with lethal injections. In 1990, Steven Jenkins, a terminally ill AIDS patient, was shot by his friend Philip Saylor in a Los Angeles hospital. An Alzheimer's patient traveled 2,000 miles to Michigan, in1990, to commit suicide with the help of Dr. Jack Kevorkian. Four bachelor brothers lived together on a farm in Madison County, California. In 1990, William Ward, 64-years-old and ill with tumors, died of suffocation, and Delbert Ward was charged with second-degree murder. In 1990, Florida officials signed clemency orders for an 81-year-old man convicted of shooting his ailing wife in what he said was a mercy killing. His wife had Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis. Virginia Harper, suffering from cancer, wanted to end her life. In 1990, she took sleeping pills; her husband waited until she was asleep and then slipped a plastic bag over her head. Bertram Harper was arrested for murder. Dr. Alan Cox was tried and convicted in Winchester, England, for the attempted murder of a patient in 1992. The doctor's choice of drug to end a patient's suffering was not a painkiller, but a heart stopper.", "There are two major end-of-life issues that generate legal, moral, and religious controversies; mercy killing and removal of life support. Those accused of mercy killing are tried for murder or manslaughter. The following are some recent cases. Philip Saylor shot his friend, Steven Jenkins, a terminally ill AIDS patient at Cedar-Sinai Medical Center. Caroline Youngquist, a volunteer for the Hemlock Society, often assists people with information on how to take their own lives. However, she has not directly assisted in a suicide. Rudolfo Linares removed the respirator from his comatose infant son. An Alzheimer patient traveled from California to Michigan for an assisted suicide. Dr. Kevorkian administered a lethal dose of chemicals to the woman. Kevorkian is an outspoken advocate of doctor-assisted suicide. In a small rural community in Wisconsin, Delbert Ward was accused of suffocating his brother who was suffering from tumors of the neck, kidney, and prostate. No one is sure if Mr. Ward actually committed the crime. More often, right to die issues involve decisions to remove life support. The legality of making such decisions varies from state to state. The Supreme Court ruled in 1990 that states may bar the removal of life-sustaining treatment from comatose patients who have not made or cannot make their desires known. In a poll of the American public, most people approved laws that allow life-support to be removed from a terminally ill patient. Only a third of adults say that could take part in a mercy killing.", "Passive mercy killings occur when people who are brain-dead or permanently comatose or vegetative after injury, accident or illness are removed from life-support equipment (feeding tubes or respirators). Cases include bomb victim David Heffer; abused children Shantana Speake and Thomas Griffin; gunshot victims Gema Marie Hubler and Tanya Marie Rivera (only after giving birth); injury victims Tony Bland, Karen Eickholdt, Joel Christopher Banks, and Mark Weaver; stroke victim Estelle Browning; and cocaine-imbibing Maximo Rene Mendez. Paralyzed patients Nancy Gamble and Kenneth A. Bergstedt requested that their life support be removed. Rudolfo Linares removed his son Samuel from life support while holding hospital staff at gunpoint to prevent intervention. Routinely, doctors, patients or relatives decide whether potentially life-prolonging treatments should be started, stopped, or continued. Active mercy killings include Philip Lee Saylor who shot his AIDS-suffering friend Steven Charles Jenkins; Roswell Gilbert who shot his Alzheimer-suffering wife Emily; a man who shot his fatally lion-mauled friend; British doctor Alan Cox who gave an elderly patient a heart-stopping injection; Delbert Ward who suffocated his ill brother William in his sleep; and three Austrian nurses and West German nurse Michaela Roeder who gave patients lethal injections. Mercy-driven assisted suicides include Dr. Jack Kevorkian who started an IV saline solution for Alzheimer patient Janet Elaine Adkins, who then added coma-inducing thiopental and heart-stopping potassium chloride; and Bertram Harper who placed a plastic bag over his ill wife Virginia's head when sleeping pills and alcohol put her to sleep before she could do it herself.", "Most mercy killings occur when a patient is in a persistent vegetative state, with no hope of recovery, and family members or guardians request that artificial life support be removed. Often, court orders are required to have this done. Frequently, patients are victims of accidents or crime, such as David Heffer, Tony Bland, Mark Weaver, and Karen Eickholdt. Doctors did not need court permission to remove Nancy Gamble's life support when the paralyzed Lou Gehrig's patient requested it herself. Sometimes, family members or loved ones feel compelled to take matters into their own hands. The father of 15-month old Samuel Linares, comatose since swallowing a balloon, held a gun on a nurse, disconnected his respirator, and held him until he died. Steven Jenkins, a terminally ill AIDS patient, was shot by a friend. William Ward, who suffered from possibly cancerous tumors and very poor health, was smothered by his brother Delbert. While Virginia Harper slept, her husband put a plastic bag over her head and secured it with rubber bands, after the advanced cancer sufferer failed in her suicide attempt. Roswell Gilbert shot his wife Emily, who suffered Alzheimer's and osteoporosis. Active euthanasia, like Dr. Kevorkian's assisting Alzheimer's sufferer Janet Adkins to use his suicide device, is considered immoral by some ethicists and illegal by some states. Hospital nurses were arrested in Austria for killing patients, some of whom were not terminally ill, with lethal injections. A German nurse was convicted of manslaughter and mercy killing in a similar case.", "Mercy killings usually have taken place when a person on a life-support system is determined to have no chance of recovery. In most cases, the patient is comatose or mentally unable to communicate his/her feelings and the decision to remove the life-support system is made by relatives in agreement with hospital administrators or upon authority of a local judge. There are, however, instances when a grief-stricken relative without agreement or consent of authorities removes life-support systems. Also there are cases wherein terminally ill patients have knowingly requested to die by mercy killing. In California, a number of authorized hospital mercy killings have occurred: a teenaged declared brain dead from a gunshot wound; a comatose daughter accidentally short in the head; a five-year old boy comatose4 from consuming 10 oz. of bourbon; a 26-year old man alive for five years after stab wound to the neck; and a 19-year old girl declared brain dead after a save beating. Instances of authorized mercy killings at request of patients were a paralysis victim in California and a paraplegic in Nevada after 24 years on a respirator. In Michigan, without authority, Dr. Jack Kevorkian gave a woman with Alzheimer's disease access to a device that allowed her, at her own request, to inject lethal chemicals into her body. In other illegal cas4es, a terminally ill woman died request requesting her husband to slip a plastic bag over her head and a father, holding a pistol, disconnected a respirator from his comatose fifteen-year old son.", "In almost 80% of deaths in the US, a doctor, relative or patient makes a medical decision whether to prolong a life either by beginning, continuing, or ending a procedure. Turning off a respirator ended the lives of brain dead including Shantana Speake, beaten; Thomas Griffin, alcohol poisoning; Maximo Mendez, cocaine poisoning; Gema Hubler, shot; Joel Banks, skate board accident; Karen Eickholdt, car accident; and two pregnant women, Tanya Rivera and Marie Henderson, after their babies were delivered. Some people request that their respirator be stopped including Nancy Gamble, a Lou Gehries disease victim, and quadriplegic Kenneth Bergstedt. Samuel Linares' father held a nurse at gunpoint as he removed the child's respirator. Estelle Browning (stroke victim), Mark Weaver (stab wounds), and Tony Bland (crushed at a game), all in persistent vegetative states, died after feeding tubes were removed. The US Supreme Court prevented the same fate for Nancy Cruzan. Illegal medical killings include one by a British doctor, 35 killed by Austrian nurses, and six killed by German Michaela Roeder. Mercy killings also occur outside a medical institution. Husbands kill wives, e.g. cancer victim Virginia Harper was suffocated and Emily Gilbert, Alzheimer's sufferer, was shot. William Ward, who \"had trouble with his mind\", was shot by his brother. A terminal AIDS victim and a man mangled by a lion were shot by friends. The Hemlock and British Voluntary Euthanasia societies provide directions for committing suicide. Dr. Jack Kevorkian provided directions and implements for Janet Adkins to kill herself."]}

Is government financing required for construction?", "summaries": ["Magnetic levitation rail systems are being developed in several countries. The revolutionary technology is being tested in Japan and Germany. However, actual construction has not yet begun. In Japan, development is underway for a proposed Tokyo-Osaka line. Construction would be government funded. Service is expected to begin after 2000, but high costs and difficulties obtaining land could delay it indefinitely. Germany has approved development of a Hamburg-Berlin \"maglev\" line. The government, which already has spent DM1.6bn on research and development, will fund construction, while a private consortium will operate the service. Service is expected to begin in 2005. In the US, maglev projects have been proposed for the Los Angeles and Las Vegas areas. The California project would link downtown Los Angeles, Orange County and the San Fernando Valley. The line would serve commuters and airport-bound travelers. It would also serve gamblers headed to Las Vegas via the proposed 69-mile Anaheim-Las Vegas line. The Los Angeles area line originally was to be privately funded. California state law prohibits the use of federal or state funds. However, because ridership estimates have been reduced by half, some county government financing will be necessary. Issues of costs and rights of way have delayed approval of the Los Angeles area project. The two projects are not expected to begin service before 1997. In Switzerland, the government and 80 Swiss companies are financing a feasibility study for an underground maglev system. The proposed Geneva-St. Gallen and Basle-Bellinzona lines would take eight years to build.", "Magnetically levitated (maglev) trains are propelled along a guideway by electromagnetic forces on a slight cushion of air. In the early 1990's, maglev technology was under development in Japan and in Germany. The Railway Technical Research Institute, an affiliate of Japan Railroad with national and local government support, was building a 27-mile test track. HSST Corporation of Nagoya, a public-private joint venture, was promoting maglev system for both intercity and commuter uses. In Germany, three engineering groups, Thyssen, AEG, and Siemens, together with Lufthansa and the German railway system, joined forces to form a new company to develop and build a maglev train between Hamburg and Berlin, and possibly to Bonn, Bremen and Cologne. The system was to be built with public funds and operated by the new company. In 1990, the HSST Corporation offered to pay for a 155.6-mile maglev commuter system linking downtown Los Angeles, Orange County, and the San Fernando Valley. Also in 1990, California evaluated proposals to construct a 65-mile maglev system from the Los Angeles International Airport through the San Fernando Valley to Palmdale. The system would serve both commuters and travelers to the airport. Construction costs were to be paid with a combination of state and private funds, and the state was to provide rights of way. Again, in 1990, California designated a consortium to build a privately funded 265-mile maglev system between Anaheim and Las Vegas. In 1994, Switzerland began a feasibility study for an underground maglev train between Geneva and Zurich.", "The magnetic levitation (maglev) train is based on a technology developed in German and granted a patent in 1933. Three of Germany's leading engineering groups are joining forces to develop and build a maglev train between Berlin and Hamburg on a part private financing plan with the government. Japan is planning to investigate a maglev train Tokyo and Osaka. Another Japanese company is promoting a scheme for an intercity maglev in Nagoya. The Swiss have a feasibility study for a maglev train system that would travel through tunnels at very high speeds. There are several proposals for maglev trains in the US, for both short and long haul lines. Private investors could begin construction of a $600M German maglev link between Orlando, Florida, airport and Disney World. Several proposals have emerged for maglev rail lines in the Los Angeles area and between California and Nevada. A Japanese company indicated willingness to pay for a maglev line linking downtown Los Angeles, Orange County and the San Fernando Valley in exchange for rights along freeways and exclusive operating arrangements. The Bechtel Corporation has proposed a maglev train between Anaheim and Las Vegas but conceded that it cannot be financed and built without some public funds and granted rights of way along Interstate 15 in California and Nevada. A private partnership is considering a bid to build a maglev line from Los Angeles International Airport through the San Fernando Valley to Palmdale.", "Magnetic Levitation (MAGLEV) Rail systems have been proposed in four countries: Japan, Germany, the United States and Switzerland. In Japan by 1992 the Railway Technical Research Institute, with national and local government support, was building a 27-mile track to test MAGLEV rail cars as part of a project to connect Tokyo and Osaka by MAGLEV. HSST Corporation of Nagoya was promoting an inter-city MAGLEV railway. By February 1994 plans for a prototype line near Tokyo were stalled due to problems with land acquisition. By June 1990 Bechtel Corp., teamed with the West German Transrapid Group, had developed a MAGLEV train at a 20-mile test track near Emsland. In July 1992, three leading engineering groups, Thyssen, AEG and Siemens, joined to develop the \"whispering arrow\" magnetic hovertrain. In March 1994 the German government approved construction of the world's first commercial MAGLEV line between Berlin and Hamburg. The federal government agreed to pay for construction while a consortium would finance a private operating company. In the United States by 1993 small MAGLEV systems were in operation in Orlando, Florida and Las Vegas, Nevada, but after prolonged debate, delays and rising costs, elaborate plans for a MAGLEV line between Los Angeles and Las Vegas had been abandoned in 1990. In 1993 the Swiss government financed a feasibility study for Swissmetro, a MAGLEV rail system between Geneva and St. Gallen and from Basle to Bellinzona. The Swiss project would operate in dual tunnels with lowered atmospheric pressure and air resistance."]}
{"id": "D370I", "query": "What rules have been imposed regarding food labeling and by whom? What doesn't need to be on a label? What infractions have been discovered and what penalties imposed? What are continuing problems?", "summaries": ["In 1987 the FDA abandoned a rule prohibiting health-related messages on food, now permitting claims with some scientific support. In 1989 it required labels to list net weight, ingredients, sodium and Yellow Dye No. 5, but not nutritional information unless nutrients were added or claims made. The meaning of \"natural\" was restricted. New FDA rules to be fully implemented in mid-1993 required labels to show serving size (standardized for 159 product categories), number of servings per container, calories per serving, fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total and complex carbohydrates, sugars, fiber, and protein. Health claims had to meet strict definitions. Definitions of low fat, high fiber, cholesterol-free, reduced-cholesterol, light, etc., were standardized. Bulk food in bins, raw fish, and fruits and vegetables needed to be accompanied by nutritional information. Spices, food in very small packages, and food sold in outlets with annual sales less than $500,000 were exempt. Not required was identification of genetically altered products, thiamine, riboflavin, or niacin. American Heart Association labels on healthy foods were to be discontinued. Meat and poultry label jurisdiction fell to USDA. California required warnings on carcinogens and mutagens. The European Commission also enacted label changes effective October 1993, requiring clearer information on additives, ingredients, storage temperatures, and nutritional claims, and product descriptions as well as customary names. Austria passed similar laws. Labeling infractions included misuse of the terms \"fresh\" and \"Italian,\" false calorie and nutritional information, and the Austrian practice of repackaging foods with new sell-by dates when old ones were met.", "In 1992 the FDA made significant changes to labels on food products. Before 1992 food processors did not have to list nutritional information on labels unless they had added a nutrient to the food. At that time a comprehensive label consisted of three basic parts; the amount of calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates, and sodium per serving. There were fairly liberal regulations permitting health claims so that a high fiber cereal, for example, could contain a message claiming the cereal would reduce the risk of colon cancer and heart disease. During this period several companies, including Ragu and Proctor and Gamble, were cited for misleading consumers. The definition of serving size was unclear so that a 12 ounce can of soda was described as being two servings although it was usually consumed by one person straight from the can. The new FDA regulations give consumers more nutritional information. Every packaged item must give full details of caloric and nutritional content. New strict definitions exist for terms such as low-fat, high fiber, light, or sodium-free. Cholesterol- free means specifically that the product has less than 2 milligrams of cholesterol and low-cholesterol is defined as less than 20 milligrams per serving. More information must be given for perishable foods and the temperatures at which they should be stored. Information about food additives and ingredients must be presented according to uniform rules. The definition of serving size has been standardized. The European Union adopted many of the same guidelines during the same period.", "Food labeling rules have been imposed in the US by the Food and Drug Administration and by the Department of Agriculture. In Britain, the Food Minister has imposed labeling rules. The European Council of Ministers and the World Trade Organization have imposed labeling rules. Rules in the US call for listing calorie content and the amount of protein, fat, carbohydrates, sodium, cholesterol, and fiber per serving size. Ingredients are to be listed in descending weight order. Also, to be listed are the recommended daily allowance of certain nutrients. Guidelines have been set for a product to be labeled \"fat-free\", \"cholesterol-free\", and \"alcohol-free\". Spices, restaurant food and small packages do not need to be labeled. Also, it is no longer required to list the amounts of thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin in products. In the US, the FDA can bring enforcement action against violators and has warned Proctor and Gamble for mislabeling orange juice made from concentrate. Ragu Foods was cited for misleading consumers by labeling a processed pasta sauce as fresh. Austrian food retailers routinely repackage sausages and ham with new sell-by dates after original dates have passed. The FDA is against third-party endorsements such as was done by the American Heart Association in its HeartGuide program. Problems with labeling are expected to continue in dealing with terms such as \"lite\", \"reduced\" and \"low\" as applied to calories, fat, and sugar.", "The U.S. Congress approved legislation in 1990 to require nutrition labels on packaged foods. Bulk food in bins, raw fish, and fruits and vegetables must be displayed with a sign providing nutritional information. Food sold by restaurants, cafeterias, hospitals and grocers with annual sales of less than $500,000, is exempt. The FDA does not require that genetically altered products be identified on the label. Food labels must display serving size; number of servings per container; calories per serving and number of calories from fat; amount of fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates, sugars, dietary fiber, and protein. The European Community's council of ministers approved, in 1900, a requirement that food products making nutrition claims carry information on their labels stating nutrients they contain. In the U.S., the FDA banned most health messages on food labels. The FDA and the Department of Agriculture also have regulations about labels that claim food to be \"natural,\" \"organic,\" \"fresh,\" \"no-sodium,\" \"low-cal\" and \"lite.\" In 1990 the FDA cited Ragu Foods, Inc., for the use of \"fresh\"; they cited Phoenix cookie makers for high fiber, low calorie claims. No penalties were levied. The FDA threatened to seize orange juice produced by Procter & Gamble, claiming that the product was not \"fresh.\" Continuing problems were objections to exempting genetically-altered products from labeling, and that to learn fat content in meat, one had to know that FDA ratings like \"choice\" beef contains about 16 grams of fat, compared with \"select,\" which contains only 5-1/2 grams."]}
{"id": "D436J", "query": "What causes train wrecks and what can be done to prevent them?  Train wrecks are those events that result in actual damage to the trains themselves not just accidents where people are killed or injured.", "summaries": ["Multiple reasons cause train wrecks. Weather, including fog and torrential rains, can be a cause. Human factors are a common cause. Vehicle drivers ignore or try to out run crossing signals or break through crossing gates. Engineers ignore or fail to see signals directing them to stop their train. Both operators can be under the influence of alcohol or marijuana. Cars can be improperly coupled and break free. Mechanical and equipment failures are often the cause. Brakes can be faulty or disconnected, tracks can be warped or cracked; wheels can be faulty; individual cars may have faulty braces; or switches may malfunction. Signals may fail to operate properly, especially dangerous during single-track operations. In South Korea, accidents were blamed on lax safety standards, non-enforcement of regulations, and corruption. Combining modern faster equipment with older slower trains can result in rear end collisions. Vandalism continues to be a problem. Solutions include replacing older equipment, installing data recorders, spreading passengers out through trains, and improving buffering in stations. Drivers' training should be reviewed and they should be given follow-on training including practice in emergency situations. Drivers' fitness should be determined and alcohol and drug impairment should be illegal and tested for after an incident. Regulations to improve crew communication were called for. British Rail proposes installing an Automatic Train Protection system to take over for the engineer if signals or speed directions are not followed. Amtrak was planning special mechanisms to derail runaway cars before collisions. Track inspections remain vital.", "Train wrecks are caused by a number of factors: human, mechanical and equipment errors, spotty maintenance, insufficient training, load shifting, vandalism, and natural phenomenon. The most common types of mechanical and equipment errors are: brake failures, signal light and gate failures, track defects, and rail bed collapses. Spotty maintenance is characterized by failure to consistently inspect and repair equipment. Lack of electricians and mechanics results in letting equipment run down until someone complains. Engineers are often unprepared to detect or prevent operating problems because of the lack of follow-up training needed to handle updated high technology equipment. Load shiftings derail trains when a curve is taken too fast or there is a track defect. Natural phenomenon such as heavy fog, torrential rain, or floods causes some accidents. Vandalism in the form of leaving switches open or stealing parts from them leads to serious accidents. Human errors may be the most common cause of train accidents. Cars and trucks carelessly crossing or left on tracks cause frequent accidents. Train crews often make inaccurate tonnage measurements that cause derailments or brake failures, fail to heed single-track switching precautions, make faulty car hook-ups, and, in some instances, operate locomotives while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Some freak accidents occur when moving trains are not warned about other trains stalled on the tracks. Recommendations for preventing accidents are: increase the number of inspectors, improve emergency training procedures, install state-of-the-art warning, control, speed and weight monitoring mechanisms, and institute closer driver fitness supervision.", "Human errors that cause train wrecks occur in coupling, braking, setting or working on switches, and misreading or disobeying signals. Marijuana or alcohol can be a factor. Collisions with other trains result from runaway cars, switching or signal errors, or slow-moving or stalled trains. Collisions with vehicles at crossings result from drivers disobeying or not seeing warning signals, vehicles getting stuck on tracks, or suicides. Emergency dispatchers may fail to notify railroads of obstructed track. Equipment problems causing wrecks include malfunctioning brakes, signal failures, warped or cracked track, faulty cross-braces, and defective wheel systems. Management practices contributing to train wrecks include insufficient attention to maintenance, training, regulation enforcement, and the possibility of an emergency. Risky cost-cutting measures, corruption, and bad employee morale also contribute. Other factors contributing to train wrecks include fog, railbeds and supports weakened by tunneling or rains, too few railroad inspectors, aging equipment, and vandalism. A systematic approach to identifying, managing and monitoring hazards could check errors and prevent accidents. Training is needed to keep people current on new equipment, safety and communication requirements, and all aspects of train handling. Supervisors need to ensure employees are fit for work. Equipment can be updated and crossings and buffer stops redesigned. More inspectors can be hired. Computerized systems such as Automatic Train Protection can take over if sensing a wrong decision or non-response to signals, and can adjust a train's speed on entering a station. A special switching mechanism in a trainyard can automatically derail loose cars.", "Causes of train accidents found by investigations fall into these categories. Faulty or damaged equipment include track, wheels, breaks, signaling equipment and cargo braces. Human factors include driver errors; not complying with light signals; signaling procedure errors; improper coupling of cars and engines; improper breaks connections; inaccurate cargo manifests; poor communication among train crews; poor communication between police and railway operators; improper switch operation; vehicle error at crossings; and improper maintenance. Substance abuse includes operating a train under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Management errors include failure to train drivers in difficult maneuvers and emergency procedures, and failure to systematically implement existing policies for identification, management and monitoring of hazards. Under-funding delayed implementation of safety measures, such as installation of \"Automatic Train Protection\" systems. Natural causes include floods and ice. Other causes include poor track design, such as conversion of double track to single track for bidirectional travel; vandalism; and pedestrians on tracks, including suicides. Formal recommendations for avoiding train accidents include replacing older trains with new ones; putting data recorders on all trains; improving driver emergency training, especially regarding 1) past accident scenarios, 2) light signal compliance, and 3) emergency breaking; improving accuracy of cargo weight listings; improving communications among crews members; installing \"Automatic Train Protection\" systems; redesigning buffer stops; supervising drivers' fitness for work; making it illegal for railway workers with safety responsibilities to be impaired by alcohol or drugs; allowing drug testing after incidents; and investigating problems of sudden light changes between outdoors and illuminated stations."]}

There were many extenuating circumstances that indirectly contributed to the cause of death in LA and elsewhere. For example, San Jose police officers sued their city charging that inadequate staffing contributed to the shooting death of an officer by a crazed gunman. Two other officers died when they went to investigate a shooting incident, only to discover a pipe bomb in the garage of the home. They died when the bomb they were trying to dismantle exploded.

Other viruses include Hare KRSNA, detected in 1996; Worm.Explore.Zip, first detected in Israel, targeted Windows operating systems, deleting files in the systems of major U.S. companies; W32/Kriz.3862, designed to overwrite hard drive data and destroy setup memory on Windows systems computers, was timed to strike on Christmas Day; Killer C-disk THUS attacked through email on December 13, 1999; and the Prilissa and Mypics viruses, which could reformat hard drives were set to activate on January 1, 2000. Two Bangladesh-originated viruses were the Dhaka, later renamed T-virus, and the White Lion, which erased MS-Word document files.", "Computer viruses infect both large computer networks and personal PCs causing information loss,erasure of the hard drive, and system shutdowns,all of which slow down productivity. The first known virus to hit personal computers was Brain, rather innocuous and easy to track. Brain was followed by Chernobyl, which infected up to one million computers in Southeast Asia. Its origin was traced to the work of a computer engineering student, Chen Ing-hau, who received school demerits as a punishment. The next major virus to strike was Melissa, affecting more than 100,000 computers worldwide. David L. Smith of New Jersey has been accused of writing and sending out Melissa. Next came Happy99, author unknown, affecting tens of thousands of computers, followed by Worm.Explore.Zip, W32/Kriz.3862, and I Love You among others. Most viruses enter the computer via attachments to emails. Once opened, they send themselves around the Internet using the recipients' address books. The FBI is active in tracking down and prosecuting originators of computer viruses. The Computer Emergency Response Team, (CERT,) a Defense department funded security team also tracks viruses. The best defense against computer viruses includes installing anti-virus programs, such as Norton Antivirus or McAfee Virus Scan, and taking basic precautions. These antiviral programs must be continuously updated to react to new viruses. Precautions include making backups of all important files, and using caution when opening attachments to email messages. Attached files should never be opened if there is any doubt about the nature of the attachment, but should be immediately trashed.", "A number of new destructive viruses have been detected on the Internet and the networks of several large organizations. Three in particular - Melissa, Chernobyl and Worm.Explore.Zip - have severely damaged computer systems around the world. Melissa makes its way into computers as an e-mail attachment and sends itself around the Internet using addresses found in a recipient's computerized address book. It attacks Word 97 and Word 2000 programs. It has affected over 100,000 computers worldwide. David L. Smith, a computer programmer in Aberdeen, N.J. has been arrested and charged with writing and sending out the virus. Chernobyl enters in e-mail, floppies, or downloaded software. It attacks Windows 95 and 98 files, overwriting a computer's hard drive. It activated on April 26, the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. Its attacks reported in the US are in the hundreds and increasing. Authorities in Taiwan have identified a Taiwanese computer-engineering graduate, Chen Ing-hau, as the virus' author. Worm.Explore.Zip masquerades as a message from a friend inviting the recipient to open an attached file. When opened, it unleashes a program that wipes out contents of documents, spread sheets, and graphic presentations created by Windows 95, 98 and NT. It was first detected in Israel but its source is unknown. The \"love bug\" virus originated by a Philippine couple using Internet access cards has caused up to $2.6 billion in damage to computers in over 20 countries. A new love bug is now sending e-mails via Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express erasing every file."]}

What has the Bank done to respond to the criticisms?", "summaries": ["World Bank critics include the governments of the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and India, charities such as Oxfam, Christian Aid, and Save the Children, and environmental lobbyists such as Greenpeace. The bank has been criticized for poor management of its over 1,800 projects worldwide. The declining success rate of bank projects is partly due to its policy of rewarding more for loan volume than for the successful implementation of projects. The US criticized the bank's lack of support for the private sector in developing countries. In Africa, bank-supported structural adjustment programs have failed to halt economic and social decline and poverty. Oxfam charged the bank with encouraging the production of commodities for an already saturated world market. Charities and environmental lobbyists have attacked the banks' environmental and resettlement policies. In particular, the failed Narmada dam project in India and Chiles' Bio Bio River hydroelectric dam. Groups claimed the bank failed to conduct proper impact studies, and to protect displaced villagers. The World Bank has responded to the criticism in a number of ways. First it appointed a taskforce, which uncovered numerous deficiencies. The bank drew up plans to improve the management of its portfolio projects and to redirect incentives toward rewarding successful project implementation more than project approval. It has offered to mitigate environmental damage. It agreed to provide better access to project information and to set up an independent inspection panel to review complaints. The bank also agreed to try to limit commodity loans where markets were unfavorable.", "The World Bank embraced structural adjustment lending during the 1980s. The emphasis was on economic efficiency and trade liberalization. Oxfam and many other critics insisted that this policy failed, saying that World Bank and IMF adjustment programs led to increased poverty, widened the gap between rich and poor, gutted local productive capacity and accelerated environmental degradation in most of some 75 countries in which they were imposed. In response, Lewis Preston, World Bank president, moving away from structural adjustment, announced a new drive to make poverty alleviation the Bank's central mission in the 1990s. Many NGOs called for a halt to projects that were socially and environmentally destructive, mainly large dams. In 1992, Preston admitted that such projects had \"fallen short\" of Bank expectations and withdrew support for the huge Narmada dam project in India. A report published in 1993 by the Bank's own task force found a steady deterioration in the World Bank's performance. Projects judged unsatisfactory had risen from 15 percent in 1981 to 37.5 percent in 1991. One reason given was that the Bank rewarded loan volume rather than successfully completed projects. Acting president Ernest Stone announced a new plan to make management of projects as important as making new loans. US, UK, Canada and Australia objected to a 4.6 percent pay raise the World Bank voted itself in 1993. Politicians and others often complained about the \"fat cat\" lifestyle of World Bank staff and lavish expenditures on its new headquarters building in Washington.", "The World Bank has been the subject of criticism by non-governmental organizations and by governments. Oxfam claimed that loans in the form structural assessment programs have failed to sustain growth and to reduce poverty. Oxfam and Christian Aid criticized these programs because they force developing countries to spend their money to service debts rather than relieving poverty. Environmental groups as the Environmental Defense Fund complained about environmental and resettlement aspects of Narmada dam project in India. The Bank responded by making significant modifications to its plans. Greenpeace criticized the Bank for failing to implement programs to phase out the use of ozone-depleting substances in developing countries. Save the Children urged the Bank to give more emphasis to problems of lack of clean water and adequate sanitation. Environmental groups complained that a Bank-financed dam project in Chile violated the Bank's environmental guidelines. Britain and others attacked the Bank on its handling of the Narmada project; the Bank responded with a comprehensive management review of its portfolio. Responding to criticisms by the US, the Bank introduced measures to help the private sector as well as the public sector in developing counties. Critics asked that the Bank provide more transparency, efficiency, responsiveness, and flexibility. The Bank conducted internal reviews of the project management and introduced reforms intended to improve the success rates of their projects. They also re-engineered their managerial processes, changed their priorities, including giving more emphasis to poverty alleviation, and made changes to their skill mix, including adding more environmental experts.", "Criticism of the World Bank centered on grand projects such as huge dams which cause massive resettlement of populations and widespread environmental damage without achieving economic growth or reducing poverty. An independent group headed by Bradford Morse that investigated the Narmada dam project in India found deficiencies in the bank's appraisal of the project, in the borrower's implementation and the bank's supervision (1992). Bank president Lewis Preston said the criticism was justified but the bank went ahead with the project after requiring that India produce detailed plans for resettlement and environmental studies. India asked for cancellation of its remaining loans rather than accepting the bank's new requirements (1993). The Narmada disaster led to establishment of a bank inspection panel and extensive self-study within the bank to achieve improved efficiency and its goals of economic growth, protection of the environment and reduction of poverty in developing nations. Britain's Oxfam and a task force under World Bank veteran Willi Wapenhans concentrated on World Bank failures in Africa and South America (1992). Specific criticism was leveled at the bank's encouraging production of commodities that had already saturated the world market, using loan volume as a measurement of success, imposing pet projects on borrowers rather than responding to their needs, and failure to monitor performance of often inefficient and corrupt governments. By the end of 1994 the World Bank was under continued attack and bank seniors debated the future of their organization."]}

What are the key points and counterpoints expressed by people who hold each of those perspectives?", "summaries": ["Although there are gradations of emphasis, two basic perspectives are at the core of the debate over teaching of evolution, creation science or intelligent design in public school science classes. Scientists, science teachers and their supporters see evolution as one of five unifying concepts linking all scientific disciplines. To ignore it is to ignore science and relegate students to an inferior education and uncertain future. They see creationism as a literal reading of Genesis clearly contradicted by science and intelligent design as little more than substitution of \"intelligent designer\" for \"God\" in the Genesis account, following court decisions against teaching creationism as science. Supporters of creationism, creation science, and intelligent design are primarily fundamentalist Christians who have faith in the literal truth of the Bible. They dispute the validity of evolutionary theory arguing that there are holes in it. Intelligent design avoids mention of God saying the complexity of the design of the cosmos requires an intelligent designer. Some condemn the teaching of evolution as a form of secular humanism undermining religions, social and cultural values. Rep. Tom DeLay put the blame for the tragic Columbine High massacre on teaching children \"that they are nothing but glorified apes who are evolutionized out of some primordial soup of mud.\" In 1999 a poll showed 83% of Americans favoring teaching evolution in the public schools and 68% thinking one can both believe in evolution and that God created humans and guided their development.", "There are two advocacy perspectives on what to teach in American public school biology classes: evolution and creationism. Evolution science holds that the Earth is billions of years old, and that all species, including humans, arose over millions of years through genetic mutations and natural selection from a few initial life forms. Repeated U.S. Supreme Court rulings have found that creationism is not science, but a religious belief by some American fundamentalist Christians who literally interpret the Bible to mean the universe, the Earth and its creatures were created in six days by God only 10,000 years ago and that humans descended from Adam and Eve, not other life forms. Because evolution doesn't refer to God, creationists say \"evil-lution\" is attacking their beliefs and destroying America with \"moral relativism\". Most other faiths accommodate evolution. The constitution protects individuals' expression of religious beliefs even in public schools, but it bars government officials from favoring one religion. Some school districts teach creationism, or its variant, \"Intelligent Design\", raise unscientific challenges against evolution, or deemphasize or omit evolution from textbooks or the curriculum. New Mexico requires that only evolution be taught. Scientists, teachers, business leaders and clergy say understanding evolution as the unifying principle of biology is important for college entrance exams, employment, personal health, and citizenship. In America, 40% of scientists believe in God. Eight-three percent of the pubic favor teaching evolution in public schools. Half think evolution is unproven. Seventy-nine percent favor teaching creationism also. Forty percent favor teaching only creationism.", "Teaching the origins of life on earth is a controversial and emotional topic. The consensus amongst scientists and educators is that biology and other aspects of science cannot be mastered without first understanding evolution. Proponents of evolutionary theory use a plethora of evidence, including fossils and carbon-dating, to show how life forms mutated and branched out from common ancestors in the billions of years since the world came into existence. Scientists and clergy who believe in both God and evolution are often called upon to help the conservative public in some districts accept evolution as part of the required curriculum. Proponents of \"Creation Science\" believe a divine being created humans and other species a mere 10,000 years ago, and generally use the Bible as the ultimate authority on how the world was formed. They want to teach the evidence against evolution - : intelligent-design theory, abrupt-appearance theory, irreducible-complexity theory, and depth of topsoil. Sometimes called a pseudoscientific rival to evolution, the inclusion of Creation Science as curriculum may be a violation of the laws of church and state. Proponents of Intelligent Design don't always posit God as the creator. They want evolution to be fairly represented and juxtaposed with other theories of life, including the idea that the design and complexity of the design of the cosmos require an intelligent designer. Creative design is seen by some as a compromise and by others as an opening for religion-based teaching to be inserted into the curriculum, which would be unconstitutional.", "The theory of evolution explains how plants and animal species arise and why there is diversity among species. According to evolutionists, scientific evidence shows that life began almost 4 million years ago with simple organisms, from which humans and all other forms of life evolved gradually over millions of years. Species adapt to their environment and pass on genetic characteristics to their offspring. This theory contradicts the Biblical notion that God created man in His image. In the late 1990's, creationists began challenging the validity of evolutionary theory and the teaching of evolution in US public schools. Creationism holds that a divine being created humans and other species 10,000 years ago. Creationists claimed that evolution was a theory, not a fact, and argued that creationism is a valid teaching alternative to evolution, with the Bible as the ultimate authority on how the world was formed. Defenders of evolution argue that evolution is a theory, like any scientific explanation, but it is subject to challenge and experiment. Creationists reject the scientific method, accepting instead a doctrine of faith. Creationists argue that the earth is only a few thousand years old. The Big Bang Theory, suggests that the universe originated in a colossal explosion about 15 billion years ago. Creationists introduced into classrooms theories as \"intelligent design\" -- the idea that the universe is so complex that it must have been designed on purpose by an intelligent designer. Critics argue that it is just code for creationism, and the designer is God."]}
{"id": "D434B", "query": "What economic policies were adopted by Estonia after the collapse of the Soviet Union and what resulted from these policies?", "summaries": ["Estonia's central bank was strongly committed to a stable convertible currency. Against IMF advice it abandoned the Russian ruble. In June 1992 it introduced the Estonian kroon, backed by gold and foreign currencies and pegged at 8 kroon to the D-mark, Europe's strongest currency. Estonia adopted a rule-driven currency board that was insulated from political meddling. Initially industrial production dropped, inflation rose, and bankruptcies and unemployment threatened. But the government made restructuring and privatization of state-owned enterprises priorities. In 1993 it hired Dr. Herbert Schmidt, an expert from Treuhand which had guided East Germany's privatization, and large scale privatization took off. Estonia's new Privatization Agency considered both foreign and local tenders and made decisions based on long-term investment and employment potential. Foreigners could buy land but only for uses connected with their investment, and were restricted from some industries. Restitution of property lost in 1940 and compensation for Soviet exploitation were handled through vouchers based on years of work in Estonia, redeemable for housing, land, farm equipment, or shares of privatized enterprises. By December 1994, 80% of former state property was in private hands, excluding transport and public utilities. Strict monetary discipline had resulted in a hard currency, low inflation, a balanced budget, a fast-growing economy, steadily climbing industrial output, a fast-growing service sector, an explosion of new private businesses, thousands of new jobs, and solid investor confidence. Finland replaced Russia as Estonia's main trading partner. Average incomes shrank, with a broad salary gap between new and old style jobs.", "Following the failed coup attempt in Moscow in 1991, Estonia began a concerted program of economic and political reforms designed to throw off the legacy of Soviet rule. The principle anchor of its new economic policy was the initiation of monetary reform by introducing the kroon, a new and independent currency fully backed by newly constituted monetary reserves. It was pegged to the D-mark at a fixed rate of 1 DM = 8 EEK. Also adopted was a currency board system, which prevents Estonian banks from engaging in discretionary monetary and/or exchange rate policies. Estonia also launched a priority privatization policy starting in 1992 with the sale by auction or the restitution to former owners of small property. Large-scale privatization started in 1993 with the creation of a Privatization Agency (PA), which uses citizens' vouchers, and commercial sales of state-owned enterprises while balancing foreign and domestic investment. Another major economic change was the shifting of trade away from Russia and focusing on the pro-market West, bi-lateral free trade agreements began in mid-1992 with Finland, Norway and Sweden. Foreign business investments from Finland, US, Sweden, Italy, and Germany are opening in light industries. Russia remains an important trade partner for agriculture and industrial goods. Estonia has made a special effort to free its deep-water, ice-free seaports of Soviet military presence and is planning to open them up for passenger and freight service. Overall, 60% of enterprises are privatized, exports are growing due to foreign investment, and there is no budget deficit.", "Although some setbacks were on the Estonian scene in late 1994, in May of that year the nation was the star performer of post-Soviet nations. It was a pluralistic democracy, with a market economy and liberalized trade. The GDP and exports were growing; unemployment was 1.8%; there was no deficit; and foreign investment was flourishing. Estonia had the highest growth in the Baltics and possibly the highest in all transitional economies. Economic policies begun in 1992 made all this possible. First Estonia issued its own currency in June. This currency was backed by gold (much recovered from pre-World War II seizures) and foreign currencies, and tied to the German Mark. The nation set about replacing Russia as its main trading partner with western nations, especially Finland and the Scandinavian nations. Tax reforms were instituted including a VAT and flat-rate personal and corporate income taxes. A self-financing pension and health care system was established. Privatization was begun, but not just as the sale of assets but the purchase of management skills, technology, and capital. Transaction value was sought. One privatization agency handled all negotiations and foreigners were able to buy land for a particular use. Banking policy insisted on high liquidity and conservative lending. Planning focused on using the nation's ideal maritime resources, updating the fleet, and exploiting the entrepot enterprises. Improvements and innovations in light industry and farm production were sought. The nation tried to maximize self-sufficiency in power. In 1994 the nation instituted electronic banking.", "After gaining independence in 1991 Estonia set itself on a course towards a market economy taking the first modest steps towards privatization of state-owned companies and establishing the framework for return to its rightful owners of land confiscated after the Soviet occupation of 1940. Negotiations with Britain resulted in return to Estonia of gold deposits in the Bank of England at the time of the Soviet takeover, establishing an economic base for Estonia's abandonment of the ruble and adoption of its own currency, the kroon, tied to the German D-mark. These steps were accompanied by increased Finnish investment in Estonia, growing trade in the Baltic basin, and economic assistance to Estonia from the European Community and Finland. The transition from the Soviet command economy to a free market, however, was painful and slow. By the end of 1992 Estonia experienced falling industrial production and high inflation. By 1994 Estonia was unambiguously pro-market but purchasing power was down, the price of imports was up and privatization of agriculture was slow. With strict banking regulation, a sound currency, continued privatization and foreign investment, reserves to back up the kroon quadrupled from 1992 to January 1994. By late 1994 despite increased inflation and a decline in exports, Estonia was described in glowing terms: \"A pluralistic democracy, a market economy, liberalized trade, 60% of enterprises privatized, GDP grown, unemployment (1.8%) much lower than western Europe, no budget deficit, public debt 5% of GDP \"Wonderful!\""]}

The first official announcements were made on Aug 14. The first Russian rescue attempts did not begin until Aug 15. Its nuclear reactor was shut down and attempts to hook air lines failed, so oxygen would last only a few days. Initially, top officials refused foreign assistance. On Aug 18 the first Russian rescue capsule reached the Kursk's escape hatch, too badly damaged to dock in 7 attempts in the strong underwater currents with near-zero visibility. All crew were officially announced dead. President Putin remained on vacation until Aug 19. On Aug 21, a British mini-submarine could not dock with the terribly damaged escape hatch. Norwegian divers opened hatches to Kursk's flooded ninth compartment. Some spaces filled with air had deadly pressure. No survivors or bodies were found. During and after the incident, the Russians persistently gave contradictory reports on the Kursk's status and survival chances. Russians say the explosion was caused by collision with a non-Russian vessel or a not uncommonly encountered WWII-era mine. The NATO account, based on acoustic evidence from three of its nearby vessels, is that a torpedo misfired, detonating the warhead inside the Kursk, and that nothing had struck the Kursk. In September Russia began separate operations, first to retrieve the crewmen's bodies, by public demand, by cutting holes throughout the hull, and then to raise the entire wreck, which had no nuclear missiles onboard.", "The Russian Oscar II-class, atomic powered submarine, the Kursk, sank in the Barents Sea on August 12, 2000 during a naval exercise. The boat, one of Russia's largest, was commissioned in 1996 and carried a crew of 118. The Russians began a massive rescue effort on August 13 and announced the loss the next day, when 15 vessels and warships were involved in the search. Russian efforts to reach the submarine using underwater capsules failed and Russia talked to NATO officials. Russia turned down a French offer of help and Germany's offer of medical specialists. On August 16, Russia asked Britain and Norway to send a rescue submarine and divers. These rescue teams arrived at the scene on August 19 and began the descent to the Kursk on the 20th. The Russians confirmed all aboard were dead on the 21st. Various causes of the disaster were presented. The United States believed one of the Kursk's torpedoes misfired causing a massive explosion. Russian officials speculated that the Kursk collided with another vessel, probably a foreign submarine, or encountered a World War II mine. One German source said a Russian anti-submarine missile hit it. Putin vowed to retrieve the bodies of the crew and the vessel itself. Plans were made for an unnamed Norwegian company to begin the body retrieval operation on October 10. The Russians hoped to raise the boat in the summer of 2001 at an anticipated cost of $45 million.", "On Saturday, August 12, 2000, Russia's nuclear submarine Kursk fell to the bottom of the Barents Sea while on a training mission in international waters near the Arctic Circle. The 14,000-ton submarine settled 354 to 450 feet down, trapping 118 sailors. Possible causes of the accident were a collision (favored Russian explanation, perhaps as the Kursk rose to periscope level), an onboard explosion (most likely explanation, probably involving a torpedo and triggering further detonations), or hitting a WWII mine. Nuclear reactors powering the ship were taken off line and no radiation leaks detected. The only contact with crew, SOS signals tapped on the hull, stopped Tuesday. Probes revealed massive damage to the front of the vessel and a large hole in the hull. Repeated efforts to hook up air and fuel lines and dock with the escape hatch were frustrated by bad sea conditions. The Russian navy had no advanced rescue vessels so several countries, including the US, offered help. Russia rejected a French offer. On Tuesday it approached NATO about help and by Wednesday accepted British and Norwegian offers. Rescue vehicles arrived Saturday. Rescue operations ended two days later when divers opened the hatch and found the sub filled with water. There were no survivors. Putin's government was criticized for its delay in accepting help. Lifting the Kursk to the surface would take a year and be costly and might never be done. Sailors' bodies were to be retrieved in October or November by cutting holes in the hull.", "On August 19, 2000, a Russian nuclear submarine with 118 men aboard sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea while on a training mission. Initial reports indicated that the ship may have been involved in a collision or could have been damaged by an explosion. The ship was reported not to be carrying nuclear weapons and its nuclear reactor had been switched off. Russian navy rescue efforts were complicated by strong underwater currents and near zero visibility at the 450 feet depth where the vessel was trapped and by heavy surface storms. Examination with deep-water apparatus indicated it could have been shattered by a blast in its bow, which caused the torpedo section to fill with water. The condition of the crew could not be determined and efforts to hook air and fuel lines failed. By the seventh day, repeated attempts to dock with an escape hatch failed and Russian officials were virtually certain that all the crew were dead. After initially refusing Western aid, the Russians agreed to accept rescue submarines and divers from Britain and Norway. Norwegian divers descended with video equipment, surveyed the damage, and ultimately opened an inner hatch, which revealed heavy flooding. A British mini-submarine was unable to dock with an escape hatch. US sonar and other technical sources clearly provided no evidence of a collision. The Russians, who ultimately signed a contract with Dutch and Belgian companies to retrieve the submarine, continued to insist throughout that the sinking was caused by a collision."]}

Specify the causes of the unrest.", "summaries": ["Toward the end of the 1990's, China found itself beset with civil unrest. Workers protested job cuts at state factories resulting from government-ordered market reforms. They protested late wage payments, blaming them on waste and corruption. They protested privatization efforts that could result in the loss of jobs and pensions. Farm workers in rural areas protested reform efforts, official indifference, and corruption. Taxi drivers protested higher government fees and farmers protested higher taxes. The government generally used the police to put down protests; there were reports that regular army put down some protests. While concerned with increasing labor unrest and problems in rural areas -- domestic stability was proclaimed as China's No.1 priority -- government officials felt that their reform efforts would eventually handle the problems. In an effort to reduce social unrest, the government raised stipends for unemployed workers, raised pensions, and provided funding to retrain workers. In other efforts to reduce unrest, authorities imprisoned activist involved in organizing independent worker groups and independent democratic political parties. The government viewed the Buddhist sect known as Falun Gong as a dangerous political force and it banned the group and arrested many members. They also imprisoned political and religious dissidents. Minority faiths, especially Christianity, were suppressed, and restrictions were imposed on the press. The far west region of China experienced attacks by Muslim separatists. The government cracked down on the attackers while seeking to improve relations with newly independent Central Asian nations and getting them not to support the separatists.", "Throughout China in the period September 1998 to April 2000, hundreds of acts of civil unrest have occurred, mostly protests and demonstrations by laborers and farmers. There have also been instances of ethnic separatist acts of violence in the heavily Muslim province of Sinjiang. Political dissenters and widespread religious groups have also become targets of government suppression. Primarily, the unrest is due to China's implementation of an economic reform program to reform its largely insufficient, virtually bankrupt state sector by converting its various industries to privatization. The uncompetitive state industries are foundering on the reforms as millions of employees face unemployment and social dislocation, overdue compensation payments, pensions, and salaries. In an atmosphere of public corruption as local party officials draw illicit profits or show indifference to problems, anger begins to spread. At present, of China's 834 million labor resources, some 20 million are unemployed and another 20 million peasants are idle in rural areas. The Chinese government has responded to the social unrest in a number of ways. They react to large demonstrations disruptive of work or traffic by use of military support to local police. In fact, they have greatly expanded their secretive military branch, the People's Armed Force, specifically to quell active protests. The government also cracked down severely on dissidents critical of the Party, and has banned the Falun Gong spiritual movement. Recently, however, it has promised sweeping increases in salaries, pensions and welfare payments, and is promoting democratic management of local affairs in rural areas.", "Peaceful protests in Tiananmen Square calling for democratic reform were met by the Chinese government's declaration of martial law and use of troops that shot their way through Beijing on June 4, 1989, killing hundreds. Since that time there have been repeated cases of civil unrest drawing less violent responses. Most of the unrest in following years was related to government introduction of market reforms resulting in disbandment of government enterprises with attendant widespread unemployment and overdue pension payments. Charges of pervasive government corruption fired the economic grievances. Government response, both local and national, generally consisted of hearing the protesters' complaints and taking such remedial actions as delaying unpopular programs, paying overdue pensions, providing government retraining programs, and increasing stipends of unemployed workers and welfare payments. There were also repeated protests by farmers over high government taxes and inadequate compensation for land seized in redevelopment. Although force was sometimes employed in response it usually involved police rather than armed forces. While authorities often listened to grievances, there were still cases of arrest, beatings and torture. Government reaction to separatist, religious and political dissidents was more forceful. The Moslem ethnic separatists in Xinjiang were treated as a terrorist organization while leaders of the Buddhist spiritual group, Falun Gong, were forced to attend special schools to study Communist literature and recant allegiance to their group. By 1999 several thousand political and religious dissidents were imprisoned and new restrictions had been imposed on the press and internet.", "Hundreds of economic protests have occurred in response to China's economic reforms. Slowed growth, rising layoffs and unemployment, and the perception of official indifference and corruption have sparked protests by Chinese workers and farmers across the country. Retirees have protested their lack of pension payments; residents evicted for redevelopment protested the government's failure to allocate new housing; farmers protested high taxes; taxi drivers protested new fees; factory workers demanded back pay; and farmers protested non-payment for land taken for development. In 1989, the Chinese government responded to student protests in Tiananmen Square by declaring martial law and resorting to military armed confrontation with protestors. Recently, the government's response to protests has been repression and nationalist campaigns to distract attention from economic grievances. Most demonstrations have ended peacefully, dealt with by police forces. Officials have agreed to hold discussions with protesting groups and to make back payments. They have been ordered to halt secret decision-making. However, violent rioting in Yangjiazhangzi overwhelmed regular police, who needed the help of regular army troops. Muslim separatists have carried out terrorist attacks. In response, China has sought to improve relations with newly independent Central Asian states to discourage their support of the separatists and has increase police forces in the area. The government fears that rapidly growing religious cults and political dissident groups would spark unrest that might link with labor unrest. Consequently, leaders of the cult Falun Gong have been detained for retaining, and political unrest has been dealt with by lengthy prison terms."]}

He has met with various dictators, including Yasser Arafat, Kim Il-sung, and Daniel Ortega, to plead the case for peace and obtain the release of some 50,000 political prisoners. In addition, he and his wife, Rosalynn, established the Carter Center in 1982. This center is focused on efforts to ensure free elections and fight several third world diseases. Delegations from the Carter Center, frequently led by President Carter, have observed and evaluated elections all around the world. Elections have been observed in at least 10 Central and South American countries, including Mexico, Panama, and Peru. In 1998 the Center initiated a project called \"Transparency for Growth in the Americas\". The Center's delegations have observed elections in China (where Carter fosters his one-China policy), Indonesia, Nigeria, Liberia, and Mozambique. Since 1987 the Center has been committed to the eradication of river blindness in Africa. This disease is caused by black flies and 18 million people were infected by 1999. The Center is also fighting Guinea-worm disease in Africa and Asia. In 1986 an estimated 3 million people were infested each year with this roundworm. In 2000 the Center recognized Pakistan for being the first Asian nation to eradicate the disease. In 1999, the Center initiated its first program aimed at eradicating trachoma, another eye disease caused by black flies, which has blinded 6 million people and infected millions more.", "In 1982, former US president Jimmy Carter and his wife founded the Carter Center, devoted to observing countries and furthering their democracy and development, human rights issues, and public health. Carter Center observer missions, often including former heads of state, have monitored at least 20 elections in 16 countries, including China, the Dominican Republic, Guyana, Indonesia, Liberia, Mexico, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. Carter's involvement helped persuade Ortega to accept Nicaraguan election results that deposed him, persuade Cedras to leave Haiti and avoid a US invasion, win freedom for thousands of political prisoners, and possibly avert war in Korea. The Carter Center has received funding from Coca-Cola for a project to encourage openness in government, combat corruption, and curtail bribery in Latin America. Thugs have threatened Carter's life. He has been criticized for getting in the way and for announcing deals to CNN before telling Washington. Since 1987, the Carter Center has worked to treat and prevent diseases causing blindness in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, including trachoma and river blindness. It is responsible for the near global eradication of Guinea worm disease. It has been aided by a Lions Club grant and medicines donated by Merck and Pfizer. Carter has become known as the greatest ex-president in US history. He has written books on elections and the Middle East, visited 115 countries on humanitarian missions, been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and earned adulation throughout Latin America and Africa.", "Former President Jimmy Carter has played an active role on the international stage. Working in conjunction with the Carter Center that he founded and the National Democratic Institute of International Affairs, Carter has led many international teams of observers to monitor elections throughout the world. By 1999 he had monitored more than 20 elections in 16 countries including Nicaragua, Liberia, Nigeria, Venezuela, China (village and township committee elections), Indonesia, Mozambique, Peru, the Dominican Republic and Mexico. Carter has visited 115 countries to promote peace and human rights or to combat disease and hunger. He is credited with gaining release of approximately 50,000 political prisoners, not hesitating to meet personally with such leaders as Yasser Arafat, Kim-Il-Sung, Daniel Ortega, Haitian bully Raoal Cedras and Bosnian Serb Radovan Karadzic. In 1998 the Carter Center devoted a $1.5 million grant from Coca-Cola to \"Transparency for Growth in The Americas,\" a program for combating corruption through openness in government. Through the Carter Center, the former President has led successful campaigns against two devastating diseases: river blindness and Guineau worm disease. In 1999 the Center received grants totaling $30 million to expand programs for treatment and prevention of blindness in Africa and Latin America and to extend its anti-trachoma program from Mali to Sudan, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Niger, Ghana and Yemen. In August 1999 President Clinton awarded former President Carter the Medal of Freedom for his successes in the struggle for peace and human rights and against disease and hunger."]}
{"id": "D0605E", "query": "Describe what procedures for treatment of osteoarthritis have been attempted and the result of research on these treatments.", "summaries": ["Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It affects an estimated 18.5 million Americans, mostly over age 45. It is a degenerative joint disease that involves the breakdown of cartilage and bones through wear-and-tear injuries. Most often found in the fingers and weight-bearing joints, including the knees, feet, hips, and back, it usually causes pain and limits movement. Treatment can involve medicines, surgery, and nontraditional approaches, as well as exercise and weight control. A variety of over-the-counter and prescription medicines are used in treating osteoarthritis. They include acetaminophen, as Tylenol, for pain relief, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as Advil, Aleve, Motrin, and topical pain-relieving ointments. New NSAIDS called COX-2 inhibitors, such as Celebrex and Vioxx, are being used to reduce inflammation. Traditional NSAIDs can cause stomach irratation, ulcers, and stomach bleeding. Research indicated that COX-2 drugs reduce inflammation similarly to traditional NSAIDs while causing fewer gastrointestinal side effects. The FDA questioned whether Celebrex was actually safer for patient's stomachs than older painkillers. It was also linked to gastrointestinal hemorrhages among users in the first three months on the market. Surgery is often used relieve the pain and limited mobility of osteoarthritis. Arthroscopic knee appears to decrease knee pain, for reasons not completely understood. Some research indicated there might be a placebo effect. Nontraditional approaches used to treat osteoarthritis include acupuncture, folk remedies, such as wearing copper bracelets, and nutritional supplements, such as glucosamine, chondroitin, and certain vitamins. Some research indicated the nontraditional approaches have limited or highly questionable benefits.", "The treatment of osteoarthritis includes a number of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen. These drugs, however, cause liver damage and gastrointestinal bleeding and contribute to thousands of hospitalizations and deaths per year. New cox-2 inhibitor drugs are proven as effective against pain, with fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Studies show that glucosamine relieves osteoarthritis pain as well as ibuprofen, without the side effects, and that chondroitin stops joint degeneration, improves joint function, and eases pain. The two together appeared to reduce knee pain after 8 weeks. US studies find them to be safe and significantly more effective than placebo. Studies show that vitamin C and beta-carotene reduce the risk of osteoarthritis, and vitamin E eases arthritis pain. However, there is evidence that one form of vitamin E, gamma tocopherol, may worsen osteoarthritis. HMP-33, a ginger extract, and SAM-e also provide pain relief, seemingly without negative side effects. Exercise, weight loss, support groups, and self-help courses also have been found to reduce osteoarthritis pain. Drugs now being researched include metalloprotease inhibitors, meloxicam, and the antibiotic doxycycline. The FDA is studying the use of electromagnetic resonance to relieve osteoarthritis pain. Osteoarthritis therapies such as copper bracelets, shark cartilage, and snake or bee venom have been proven ineffective. No studies yet support the effectiveness of Tai chi, acupuncture, qi gong, ayurveda, alfalfa, or the drug methyl sulfonyl methane. Dimethyl sulfoxide is potentially harmful. Research shows that perceived benefits from arthroscopic surgery are largely from the placebo effect.", "Various treatments for osteoarthritis have proved effective in relieving pain, but none has proved to be a cure. Several have had bad side effects and some are open to suspicion as benefiting from the \"placebo effect\": i.e. the patient imagining effectiveness when, in fact, no active agent is involved. The use of aspirin, Motrin and other over-the-counter painkillers has been found to cause stomach disorders as do the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Naproxen and Ibuprofen. In 1999 the FDA approved a new class of Cox-2 inhibitors (Celebrex and Vioxx) which appeared to give pain relief without damage to the stomach, but it was not known whether there might be other side effects. In 2000 the FDA approved meloxican tablets (Mobic). Several dietary supplements and medical treatments are claimed by some patients to be effective, but scientific research has not confirmed this judgment and there is question whether the \"placebo effect\" is in play. These include a ginger extract HMP-33, glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate and shark cartilage. Procedures which claim adherents but lack scientific support include the Jacobson resonance machine which emits a weak magnetic field, injection of steroids and the drugs hyaheronan (Hyalgan) and hylan G-F20 (Synvisk) into the knee, arthroscopic surgery, acupuncture, tai chi, and stinging nettle. Researchers are also looking at an antibiotic doxycycline and vitamins C and E. There is general agreement that sufferers from arthritis benefit from weight loss and exercise. Knee and hip replacement can restore mobility.", "Osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) drugs are for pain, inflammation, and disease modification. An acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) is used to treat pain alone. Aspirin, motrin, and steroids are used for inflammation. Paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), and topical medications are for pain and inflammation. Older NSAIDS include Advil, Daypro, Lodine, Naprosyn. Three new NSAIDS containing COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitors have been developed - meloxicam (Mobic), Celebra, and Vioxx. They are painkillers that cut inflammation with no stomach distress. Hyaluronan (Hyalgan) and hylan G-F20 (Synvisk) are new injectable drugs. For disease modification doctors prescribe sulfasalazine, chloroquine, penicillamine, gold, and methotrexate. Weight loss and exercise are recommended. When other methods fail, patients may have joint replacement. Nutritional supplements -- particularly glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate -- have become trendy for treating osteoarthritis. Other non-traditional treatments include ginger extract HMP-33, bee venom, copper bracelets, Chinese herbs, acupuncture, tai chi, stinging nettle, Thunder God vine, Ayurveda, qi gong, and electromagnetic resonance. Research led scientists to develop drugs that treat the pain/inflammation-producing enzymes but not the stomach-protecting enzymes. This led to COX-2 inhibitors. Research shows HMP-33 and SAM-e (S-Adenosylmethionine) give relief from pain with no negative side effects. Meloxicam causes few gastrointestinal complications. Glucosamine and chondroitin sooth knee pain as well as ibuprophen but without side effects. However, there is not enough data on them. Electromagnetic resonance is still being tested. There is no evidence to back up claims of copper bracelets, shark cartilage, and alfalfa. Studies on acupuncture and arthroscopic surgery suggest improvement may be psychological."]}
{"id": "D633G", "query": "What is the status of British plans for re-structuring the Welsh government? How is the issue of separation from British rule being treated by Welsh and British legistators?", "summaries": ["People in Wales who speak Welsh do not feel they are full citizens under British rule while English speakers do. During the Tory years of Thatcher and Major there were demands in Wales for devolution -- establishing a parliament for Wales. Leading the devolution fight in Wales was the nationalist party Plaid Cymru. They claimed that as the UK became increasingly integrated into the European Community it was essential that Wales should be self-governing. They also wanted to be treated the same as Scotland on devolution. A referendum was held in 1979 and a majority of the Welsh people voted against devolution. Opposition was lead by Labor leader Neil Kinnock who claimed that the working class would gain nothing from a Welsh assembly. Calls for an elected assembly continued, coming mainly from the Welsh Labor party and from Plaid Cymru. Conservatives opposed devolution. Since the 19th century Tory ideology included opposition to separatist movements. John Major in opposing devolution claimed it would raise taxes. He asserted that the best interests of Wales would be served if existing arrangements were continued. Tony Blair in the 1994 election campaign said that a Welsh assembly would be established in the first year of a Labor government. John Major favored a referendum. The British government in 1993 planned a reorganization of local government in Wales. It wanted to replace 8 counties and 37 districts with 21 new authorities. Some Welsh political leaders were concerned that these changes could undermine the independence of local government.", "In 1992, the British prime minister, John Major, rejected a call for a Welsh parliament with devolved powers by a Welsh member of parliament. Major reminded him that results of an earlier referendum, in 1978, showed that only 18 percent of Welsh voters favored a parliament. In November 1993, the British Tory government pressed ahead with plans to reform the structure of local government in Wales by holding shadow elections to new unitary authorities as early as 1994. It intended that these councils should take over in April 1995. This was in lieu of granting demands for an independent Welsh assembly. By 1994, a strong Welsh devolution movement had developed. Calls for an elected assembly came mainly from the Labour party, the dominant political force in Wales. But a unified front was impossible. Conservatives were strongly opposed, and the policy of Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party, was to bypass an assembly and go directly for independence within the European community. Plaid Cymru was not a major force in Wales, however. In a 1987 election, the party received only 7.3 percent of the vote. The British Labour party had long supported demands by Scotland and Wales for independent assemblies. In December 1994, Tony Blair, Labour leader, and probable prime minister after an upcoming election, signaled a constitutional battle with the Tories by setting out proposals for devolution for Scotland and Wales. A Labour conference promised a Welsh assembly within the first year of a Labour government.", "From before 1992 through 1994 the UK's Tory Prime Minister adamantly resisted calls by MPs of the miniscule Wales Nationalist Party (Plaid Cymru) for devolution of British rule to a fully self-governing Wales within the European Community. The PM argued forcefully to preserve the union of England, Scotland and Wales. The Plaid MPs, as buoyed as most Scotts by North Ireland's prospective self-rule, said self-government was urgent so Wales could participate directly in forthcoming EC meetings to get funds. Plaid had only four MPs from 38 Welsh districts, who opposed self-rule in a 1979 referendum four-to-one. The opposition Labour Party, long strong in South Wales, campaigned in 1992 parliamentary elections by nurturing popularity throughout the UK for devolution. Labour MP candidates committed to create a Welsh \"assembly\", not self-government, with representation to the EC's soon-to-be-formed Committee of the Regions, \"within the life-time\" of a prospective Labour-formed UK government, as well as assemblies for the English regions, and a Scottish Parliament with taxing powers. Plaid MPs demanded Labour treat Wales as favorably as Scotland on devolution with taxing powers, and give financial aid to Wales. Remembering 1979, Labour MPs rejected Tory MPs demands for a referendum on Welsh devolution, deferring instead to their parliamentary election mandate. Concurrently, a white paper restructuring Welsh government into unitary districts, written by the British appointed Secretary of Wales, an English constituency Tory opposed to Welsh self-rule, was rejected by the Welsh Counties but supported by the underlying Districts. Implementation was postponed until at least 1995.", "As of December 1994 the issue of restructuring the Welsh government (devolution) remained a hot issue in Britain. Basically the Labour Party under the new leadership of Tony Blair had pledged to create a Welsh assembly within a year of its election to power. (Devolution had not been a major issue in the 1992 general election). The ruling Conservative Party offered a plan in 1993 for 21 \"unitary authorities\" in Wales to replace the existing 8 county and 37 district councils as organs of local government, but opposed the creation of a distinct Welsh \"assembly\" or parliament. Conservative Prime Minister Major suggested a referendum on the issue of a Welsh assembly, but Blair countered that the issue of devolution would be central to the next general election campaign and if Labour won that would settle the issue. In Parliament Labour generally stood with Blair while Conservatives preached national unity. The Council of Welsh Districts urged the government to go ahead with its plan for 21 unitary authorities while the Assembly of Welsh Counties rejected the plan holding out for a Welsh Assembly.", "The Conservative led government in the United Kingdom in the early 1990s argued that the people of Wales \"realized\" that the best interest of their country and of the UK was to sustain the present arrangements. They argue that national assemblies lead to unnecessary, unwanted and costly bureaucracy. The government does plan to restructure local government in Wales in which eight county and 37 district councils would be replaced by 21 unitary authorities. Welsh associations stated opposition to these proposals and said that reorganization should not be considered until the government agreed to create a directly elected Welsh assembly. A Labor led government, however, wants devolution for Wales and the establishment of a Welsh Assembly. Within the first year of a Labor government devolution would be expected and a Welsh assembly granted. Wales has been characterized as a country divided by language. Those who speak the language support Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party whose policy is to bypass an assembly and go for an independent Wales within the European community. The nationalists, however, are a minority in their own country. The conservatives in Wales are opposed to devolution and believe that a strong Welsh Office with a cabinet minister is best. Popular support, though, is for Welsh devolution.", "In early 1992, the British Prime Minister rejected a call by the Welsh Nationalist party for a Welsh parliament. He reminded them that on an earlier occasion when there appeared to be a majority in favor of devolution, a referendum had produced a contrary result. At that time, the Welsh Nationalist Party, Plaid Cymru, launched its manifesto urging self-government for Wales within the European Community (EU) noting that it was not just a distant aim but an urgent necessity and essential for democracy. Wales is following in the footsteps of Scotland and moving towards increased support for an elected assembly with devolved powers along the lines advocated by the Labor party. A recent poll indicated that 47 percent favored an elected assembly, 31 percent were against, and 21 percent were \"don't knows\". In the 1979 referendum on devolution, the vote was four to one against an assembly. The British PM has affirmed that \"England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland together are far, far greater than the sum of their parts\". The Labor party, however, anxious for Plaid Cymru support, has promised to set up a Welsh assembly within its first year of government. The Welsh nationalists want to bypass an assembly and go directly for an independent Welsh republican state it Europe. Support for a national cause in Wales may be severely limited. Wales is divided by language with those who speak Welsh considering those who don't as not full citizens. Also, conservatives and business people look east to London.", "On December 31, 1994 a fight was expected to begin on the devolution of parliamentary powers to Wales. Tony Blair, the Labor party leader, planned to pursue his intentions to set up a Welsh assembly. The Conservative party leader, John Major, called Blair's plan the most dangerous propositions ever put before the British nation. The most recent push for self-rule for Wales became strong in 1992. White papers recommended government reforms, which replaced the eight county councils and 37 district councils with 21 unitary authorities. Plans were to create shadow councils for Wales and have them operational by the spring of 1995. In 1993 these plans were delayed for one year with shadow council elections scheduled for 1995 and in place in 1996. Support for the devolution of Wales generally followed party lines. In 1992 Conservatives called the present arrangement the best for the UK and even the Welch minister, Alun Michael, did not consider devolution an issue. Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party of Wales, called for a Welsh parliament and wanted full self-government for Wales within the European Community. By 1994 Plaid Cymru demanded equal rights with Scotland for self-determination. Labor party leaders continued to back regional administrations for Wales and an elected assembly, although the 1992 party leader Neil Kinnock said the working class would gain nothing from the changes. The Liberal-Democratic party leaders in 1992 believed there was popular support for devolution and in 1994 minister Paddy Ashdown said he possibly would support the assembly.", "Proposals for the governing of Wales split more along party lines than national divisions. Proposed changes in the governance of Wales and Scotland became a major political issue in the 1994 British elections. In Britain the Tories are in favor of keeping the existing relationship with Wales, perhaps with some internal restructuring of Welsh local government into districts. The Labour Party, responding to Welsh nationalist protests, favors a Welsh elected assembly giving more autonomy to that country. In Wales, countrymen are also divided on issues of separation and self-determination. These divisions fall mainly along language lines with Welsh speakers favoring separation and English speakers preferring to keep the economic benefits of being part of Great Britain. The most outspoken group for separation is the Welsh nationalist party, Plaid Cymru, led by Dafydd Wigley. With only three members in parliament, they seek support from Labour who has promised an independent Welsh Assembly. Many say that formation of assemblies would only create an expensive restructuring of current local services, (eight counties would be changed into 37 district councils,) and actually threaten local democracy. Plaid Cymru wants full independence with a Welsh parliament. Mr. Wigley's vision for the Welsh parliament is equal representation wit half the members being women. It is predicted that as of 1994, a referendum on independence in Wales would probably receive less than 50% support from its people. Because of the complexity of the issues, the Welsh government has delayed any legislation regarding proposed changes.", "Wales is following Scotland, and moving towards a call for an elected assembly with devolved powers, as advocated by the Labour Party. Labour has committed to the creation of a Welsh assembly, and party leader Tony Blair set out proposals for devolution, setting off a constitutional battle with the Tories. Conservatives oppose any form of devolution, and want to maintain a strong Welsh Office with a cabinet minister, believing that would produce the best results for Wales. Prime Minister John Major and the Tories are against the establishment of a Welsh parliament, which has eroded the usual support conservative legislators had received in Wales. Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, stepped up its campaign for equal rights to Welsh self-determination, demanding equal constitutional treatment with Northern Ireland, and Scotland. The British government is pressing ahead with plans to reform the structure of local government in Wales. It will establish an elected Welsh assembly, with law-making and financial powers, to replace the current two-tier system of county and district councils with single-purpose, unitary authorities. The government intends to set up 21 new authorities to replace the eight counties and 37 districts in Wales. Shadow elections to the new unitary authorities will be held as early as next year. Implementation of the local government reform will take place in April 1995."]}
{"id": "D0601A", "query": "Discuss conditions on American Indian reservations or among Native American communities. Include the benefits and drawbacks of the reservation system. Include legal privileges and problems.", "summaries": ["Indians comprise less than 1% of the population but tribes differ widely. Tribal burocracies are scattered and ineffective. Many reservations are remote with little access to development. Indian communities have greater than average occurrences of such problems as drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, teen pregnancy, poor education, and unemployment. Poor communications facilities impact the low literacy rate. Long rides to school means students can't stay to use school resources. There is poor health care and higher than average death rates from alcohol, diabetes, suicide, and accidents. The nature of the land -- \"held in trust\" -- effectively shuts the Indians out of conventional home loan processes. Federal aid programs are inadequate and impacted by outdated maps and census figures. Privileges of tribal sovereignty include unique hunting and fishing rights, and the ability to sell gas and cigarettes tax-free, set zooming, and ban or sell alcohol. Reservations can set up casinos, bringing jobs and money. However, only a few casinos are profitable. Furthermore, there is concern that the casinos bring many non-Indians as customers and managers, and erode historic values and traditions. Tribal sovereignty leads to a number of other issues. Some reservations impose taxes on non-native Americans who work or live on their land and who do not have any voice in the local government. Indian cigarette factories, not having to pay tax, can undersell non-reservation factories. Fishing and hunting privileges cause concern among conservationists that regions will be depleted. Many feel different rights based on bloodline is unconstitutional.", "Indian tribes on reservations enjoy a unique legal status. Their sovereignty allows them to run casinos and enjoy extraordinary fishing and hunting rights. Indians working on reservations pay federal income and social security taxes, but not state income, gasoline, or cigarette taxes. They can vote in local, state, and federal elections. Casinos have brought a new level of prosperity and opportunity to many tribes. But some are troubled by legal battles with states that either outlaw gambling or want to tax the profits. At least half the Indian population lives in poverty. Unemployment often exceeds 50%, 29% are homeless, and 59% live in substandard housing, many lacking plumbing and telephones. Students on reservations have the lowest test scores, the highest truancy and dropout rates, and the lowest rate of entering college. Schools are in disrepair, lack computers and internet access, and have few qualified teachers. Health care is the worst in the country. The death rate is 35 times higher than the rest of the population. Indians are over twice as often victims of violent crimes, 60% of which are perpetrated by whites. Confusion arises over jurisdiction for crimes committed on reservations. Minor crimes by Indians come under tribal authority. The FBI or Bureau of Indian Affairs is responsible for serious crimes. Crimes by non-Indians come under local authority. Indians are arrested over twice as often than any other racial group for alcohol-related offenses. Many children are affected by their parents' alcohol abuse through neglect and exposure in the womb.", "Life on most Indian reservations is marked by extreme poverty, drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, failed education, rising crime rates and high unemployment. At least half of U.S. Indians live in poverty. Forty-nine percent of those living on reservations are unemployed. Of the 1.43 million living on or near reservations, 29% are homeless and 59% live in substandard housing. The Indian death rate is 35 times that of the rest of the population with high incidence of alcoholism, diabetes, accidents and suicides. On the positive side the reservation system has helped preserve Indian culture, to recognize Indian sovereignty and to provide federal funds for roads, schools, clinics and a welfare system. The system also recognizes Indian fishing and hunting rights and frees residents from state taxes, while providing the right to vote in local, state, and federal elections. The 1988 Indian Gaming Act allowed reservations to operate bingo gaming and, subject to compacts with states, slot machine gaming. Several reservations near population centers have successfully established casinos that provide income to alleviate extreme poverty. More employees of casinos are not Indians so the unemployment problem is not solved. Casinos on remote reservations have not been successful and some tribes reject casinos. Federal funding is inadequate to satisfy the staggering needs of reservations. Some tribes have made claims against the federal government contesting past seizure of historic tribal lands, but this seems unlikely to solve the problems.", "Half of Native American Indians on reservations live in poverty with poor health care, substandard housing, and limited computer access. Drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, poor education, teen births, and lack of jobs creates unemployment 10 times the national average. Violent crime is increasing, especially on poor reservations. Continuing prejudice against Indians results in drunken attacks by whites. Police are insufficient and ill-equipped. Some tribes generate significant income from businesses and manufacturing. One-third of tribes offer gambling. Casinos aren't always successful and are often opposed by localities that don't want local gambling or competitors who fear untaxed competition. Many Indians leave the reservation. Others worry that tribal values and customs are deteriorating. Reservations grant tribes self-rule and reserve sovereign land for them. The federal government pays for reservation clinics, schools, and welfare. Indians on reservations with 50% unemployment are exempt from welfare caps. State taxes are not levied on Indians' reservation income. Tribes can tax non-Indian reservation employees. They can determine local zoning, fishing and hunting rules; ban alcohol; and open casinos. Tribal authorities deal with minor crimes but turn to federal help for more serious crime. Problems facing Indians and the reservation system include decreased funding for Indian programs; repeal of affirmative action laws; Indian culture and local regulations conflicting with federal or state laws, tribes not being fully recognized and having no access to federal funds; and banks unwilling to give Indians home loans that are backed by land held in trust."]}
{"id": "D0618I", "query": "What efforts are being made to combat the spread of malaria and to treat those currently affected?", "summaries": ["In recent years, 1.5 to 2.7 million people have died annually from malaria particularly in Africa, southeast Asia, and parts of India and China. Children under five years of age are especially vulnerable. Malaria has created a health and economic crisis in the affected countries. Treatment of the disease has become difficult because the malaria parasite has developed resistance to most traditional anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine and to some insecticides. Until recently chloroquine provided an inexpensive and well-tolerated treatment for malaria. Until the late 1990s, research on prevention and cures for malaria by the big pharmaceutical companies was rare. The World Health Organization in collaboration with southern African countries has been meeting to look for ways to improve the situation with a targeted goal of reducing malaria mortality by 50% by 2010. Millions of dollars from the US and other countries have been directed to the initiative. The key features are early treatment, promotion of insecticide-impregnated nets, and strengthening of each communities capacity to combat the disease. Currently the best prevention is widespread use of insecticide-treated bed nets. They have proven to dramatically reduce deaths of sleeping children. In 1998, there was hope from a plant, ching hao su, cultivated in China which was showing some success. Research had also begun looking for vaccines against malaria. In 2000, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug, Malarone, for use in malaria prevention. It combines two medications, atovaquone, used to treat lung infections and proguanil, an old malaria therapy.", "Malaria is an infectious disease caused by a parasite and transmitted to humans by a mosquito. One-third of the world's population lives where the parasite and its carrier mosquito thrive. Each year there are 300 million to 500 million cases of malaria and 2 million to 3 million deaths from the disease. Efforts to combat malaria include measures to eradicate the mosquito and measures to prevent malaria. Activities such as destroying habitat of mosquitoes and the use of the pesticide DDT have resulted in eliminating malaria in many parts of the world. Malaria, however, remains a major public health problem in Africa, parts of Asia, Latin America, and parts of the former Soviet Union. There are two important preventive measures: taking an antimalarial drug, such as mefloquine, that combats the parasite; and limiting exposure to mosquito bites by using protective clothing, repellants, and insecticide treated nets at night. Insecticide treated nets have proved to be one of the most effective tools to prevent and control malaria. Teaching people how to prevent malaria has been effective in decreasing its incidence. Prevention is especially important since there is no vaccine against malaria. Chloroquine has been the drug of choice to treat victims of malaria. However, malaria resistant to chloroquine has developed and spread. In 2000, the Food and Drug Administration approved Malarone to prevent and treat malaria. The development of malaria resistant to drugs has focused attention on the need for a vaccine against malaria and for research on new malaria drugs.", "Over the years, African health officials and leaders have met to coordinate and promote the prevention and treatment of malaria on their continent. The African Initiative for Malaria Control program covers all 46 countries. Organizations including the World Health Organization, World Bank, U.N. agencies, and Western investors work to promote research into malaria prevention and cure world-wide with campaigns such as Roll Back Malaria. These campaigns endorse the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets as the most effective tool for malaria prevention. Insecticide spraying to kill mosquito larvae and educating local populations on malaria prevention and health care awareness are other methods used to reduce the incidence of the disease. Tanzania encourages its citizens to destroy the mosquito's habitat, clean their surroundings by cutting grass and shrubs around houses, and destroying stationary water ponds. Anti-malaria drugs are used to prevent and treat the disease. Chloroquine has been used effectively for decades, but the parasite has become resistant to it in most areas. Mefloquine is used where the parasite is found to be chloroquine-resistent. Wherever malaria strains are resistant to mefloquine, Doxycycline is used. Because of severe side-effects, the drug Fansidar is used only as an emergency treatment. The new drug Malarone, a combination of atovaquone and proguanil, has been approved for malaria prevention and treatment for adults and children and is the first new anti-malaria option in over a decade. The ching hao su plant, which is cultivated in China, is used there and in Vietnam as an effective malaria treatment.", "Malaria prevention depends on two important measures -- taking a drug that combats the parasite prior to infection, and avoiding bites by the Anopheles mosquito. Chloroquine has long been used to prevent and treat malaria, and it is still used in areas where the parasite has not yet developed resistance. An alternative, melfloquine (trade name Lariam) is extremely effective but very expensive and has numerous incapacitating side-effects. Another effective alternative, doxycycline, has milder side-effects than melfloquine but be taken more rigorously. A newer drug, Malarone, a combination of atovaquone and proguanil (an old therapy), is in the process of gaining approval. It has numerous side effects but they are less serious than those of melfloquine. Researchers are now widening their focus to different aspects of the parasite's life cycle, and are developing a multi-pronged vaccine to help the immune system at various stages of the disease. Protective clothing, insect repellents, and curtains and netting (preferably insecticide-impregnated) are used for avoiding mosquito contact. People are encouraged to destroy mosquito habitats by cleaning their surroundings and removing stationary water ponds. Malaria is curable if detected early and treated appropriately. Fansidar is a standby treatment, and only used in emergencies when patients develop malaria symptoms and are far from medical care. One of the best hopes is a Chinese plant, ching hao su, which is being used in Asia as a very effective treatment, but has yet to meet international standards.

In June 1992 Czech politicians who wanted a rapid market reform and integration into the rest of Europe were elected, while the elected Slovaks were members of the nationalist-populist and separatist parties and were calling for greater autonomy. Talks on forming an interim government were scheduled, but were stalled. By 20 June the intention to split into separate states was announced. The two regional parliaments were tasked with deciding how the nation would divide. A new interim federal government was authorized to prepare for the smooth functioning of two sovereign states. President Vaclav Havel was not reelected on July 6. The leaders continued meetings and the Czechs agreed to assume the entire national debt. Briefly in early October there was again talk of creating a Czech-Slovak union, but January 1, 1993 again became the target date for the creation of two new nations. By November 16, 22 agreements were signed. The two regional parliaments signed a joint resolution on November 17 and the Federal Assembly gave approval on November 25. In December both regions signed free-trade agreements that included Poland and Hungary. Two new states were born on January 1, 1993. As 1993 progressed the Czech Republic, which had inherited most of the federal institutions along with the debt, pursued a free-market economy. Unemployment was very low. The Slovak nation had a rough start. Unemployment was high, foreign investments low, and inflation above 25%.", "In the two years after the collapse of communism in Prague, the Czech and Slovak republics were unable to agree on a political basis for future coexistence in one country. The Czech government, hoping to reach agreement on a new federal structure without the upheavals suffered elsewhere in Eastern Europe. The dominant Slovak political party under demagogic Vladimir Meciar called for greater autonomy consistent with Slovakia's increasingly sense of nationalism. The spokesman for the leading Czech party, Vaclav Klaus, favored a confederation that would not have Prague in the traditional role of footing the bill for the smaller Slovakian region's economy. Both agreed that a separation, which would nonetheless bind the two states, was feasible. In early June 1992, the two leaders agreed to form an interim federal government, with equal representation for Slovaks and Czechs to oversee the separation of the state. A series of negotiations, however, found the two states polarizing. The Slovak nationalists were wary of the Czech market reformers commitment to deal with Slovakia on an even basis, and the Czechs believed the Slovak proposals would make any confederation too loose to be effective. On June 20, 1992, both sides agreed to vote on a split into two separate states by September 30, 1992. The amicable separation became official January 1, 1993 after which the two began moving rapidly apart. The Czechs are adjusting to Western and international free-markets economy, while the Slovak Republic has inherited the communist legacy of rundown factories and incompetent government officials.", "Czechoslovakia's split up was the result of growing deep-rooted Slovak nationalism following the collapse of the Soviet bloc. Slovak nationalism was fuelled by economic difficulties arising from the loss of its principle source of industrial production, the Soviet market. Slovak politicians claimed the federal government didn't have the republic's economic interests at heart. Elections, in which Havel failed to be reelected president, brought to power Czech Prime Minister Klaus and Slovak Prime Minister Meciar. The two agreed to form an interim federal government, equally Czech and Slovak, to oversee the dissolution of Czechoslovakia and an orderly transition of federal powers to both Czech and Slovak national parliaments. In November 1992, the Czechoslovakian assembly passed a law authorizing the constitutional dissolution of the federal state. This ensured the legal break-up of the federation, and the passing of legislative powers to the Czech and Slovak republics. One year later, Slovakia's economy remains deeply in recession, with inflation over 25% and unemployment on the rise. Political infighting threatens the government and there is growing disillusionment with their confrontational prime minister. Slovakia's heavy industries were uneconomically geared to the Soviet market and it has yet to recover. Slovakia's rough start was made worse by a collapse in bilateral trade with the Czechs. There is hope that future links with Vienna will prove fruitful. The Czech Republic, having been more industrialized, needs to restructure and develop its infrastructure, but is now free to pursue its own accelerated drive toward a free market society.", "When the Soviet yoke lifted from Czechoslovakia, historic nationalistic feelings arose again. The Czechs, representing 2/3s of the country's population, were highly industrialized and Western looking with strong ties to Germany. Slovakia still had stronge ties to the East, it's factories producing heavy goods geared to Soviet markets. It was also suffering high unemployment rates. The two regions were unable to agree on a political plan for coexistence. In the election of 1992, the Slovak nationalist Movement for a Democratic Slovakia led by charismatic Vladamir Meciar, won a large percentage of the vote. His party pushed for greater economic and political autonomy for Slovakia and prevented the re-election of Vaclav Havel. Compromises for political federation failed and it was agreed that the two parts of the country would \"divorce\". Several agreements regarding currency, trade, borders, etc. were instituted. Most agreements lasted a very short time. Six weeks after the separation, each country had it's own currency. Since the breakup, Slovakia has faced economic stress, higher unemployment, and some political upheaval since many of its citizens were not in favor of complete independence. It is attempting to modernize, but is faced with the heavy costs involved. The Slovak government has managed to gain international recognition and join many world institutions. The Czech Republic, on the other hand, has been blessed with increased prosperity, one of the lowest levels of unemployment in Europe, substantial foreign investment, and a thriving tourist trade. The Republic is working toward rapid integration into the European market.", "On New Year's day, 1993, Slovaks sloughed off a thousand year subservience to Hungary and seven decades as the junior partner in Czechoslovakia and celebrated the birth of a sovereign, independent republic. But only six months earlier, most Slovaks went into the crucial general elections of June 1992 intending to negotiate a new and looser union with their richer Czech cousins, but not to be divorced from them. Opinion polls showed that independence was only sought by a small minority in both the Czech lands and Slovakia. By 1992, the polarization of politics between nationalists in Slovakia and market reformers in the Czech lands, as well as the defeat of Vaclav Havel, a strong advocate for the union, had put the federation of Czechs and Slovaks at risk. Before the elections, Vaclav Klaus, the Czech leader, rejected any \"soft options\". He turned down the looser federation proposed by Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak leader. He rejected Slovak demands for a central bank and requests for federal funds. Mr. Klaus argued that both sides should either agree on a smaller but more effective federal government or a quick divorce. Meciar agreed to the latter. It appeared that Klaus and many Czechs were relieved. A year after independence, Slovakia's economy was deeply in recession, and political infighting threatened to bring down the government. Democracy suffered in both countries as evidenced by growing disillusionment with politicians in Slovakia and widespread cynicism in the Czech Republic over corruption among business and political elites.", "The anti-communist movement in Czechoslovakia forced the collapse of the government in the \"velvet revolution\" of November 1989. As reforms got underway, tensions developed between Czechs and Slovaks. Slovakia's economic difficulties during the reforms fueled an emerging nationalism. Slovakia's unemployment rate was three times the Czech rate. Differences between the Czechs and the Slovaks came to a head in the June 1992 election. Vladimir Meciar won in Slovakian regions, bringing Slovak nationalists to power, and Vaclav Klaus won in Czech lands. Because of differing views on the future composition of the Czechoslovak republic, after the election Czech and Slovak leaders agreed to prepare to split Czechoslovakia into two separate states. In the fall of 1992 the leaders work worked on the details for dividing Czechoslovakia, ranging from division of the federal army to apportioning the foreign debt. In November, the Czech and Slovak parliaments voted to split into two independent republics in January 1993. Outlooks for the two republics during the first year differed considerably. The split left the Czech Republic free to pursue its drive towards a free-market economy. They continued privatizing efforts and built markets in the European Community, especially with Germany. Slovakia was saddled with a high concentration of heavy industry geared to the Soviet market. Its flawed leadership and its slow pace of privatization and little foreign investment hampered its ability to compete in international trade. By the end of 1993, its economy was in deep recession, inflation was above 25 percent, and unemployment was rising.", "The 1992 elections in Czechoslovakia defined the directions that the Czechs and the Slovaks were taking. The Czechs voted for rapid market reforms and integration into Europe under the leadership of Vaclav Klaus and the Slovaks voted for the party of Vladimir Meciar and its avowedly separatist agenda. The Slovaks had long been resentful of the Czech-dominated federal government and the two parts of the country could not agree on a political basis for their existence as a single country. On January 1, 1993, the agreed upon separation was official. The Czechs agreed to assume the foreign debt earlier accrued. The country's armed forces were divided, agreement was made to use a single currency for up to six months, and transport and telecommunications links were to be maintained. No customs officials or border restrictions were deemed necessary. The Czech republic had a skilled work force with wages low, making the country attractive for foreign investment. The Czechs also had one of Europe's lowest unemployment rates. Slovakia had a concentration of uneconomic heavy industries geared to the Soviet market. At the end of its first year of independence its economy was in recession with inflation and unemployment at high levels. Dissatisfaction exists in both countries, but more so in Slovakia. After a year of independence, a poll of Slovaks showed that a majority would oppose breaking up the former Czechoslovak federation.", "In June 1992 dissent was growing in the Slovak republic where there was rising nationalism and unemployment 3-times that in the Czech republic as the Czechoslovak government reduced government subsidies and moved towards a market economy. Two former communists, Vladimir Meciar and Peter Weiss, appealed to Slovak nationalism calling for Slovak sovereignty. The general elections in June eroded the political center in both republics, strengthening right-wing market reformers in the Czech republic and the left-wing nationalists in Slovakia. Slovak leader Meciar and Czech leader Vaclav Klaus made no progress in negotiations with Meciar insisting on a \"community of sovereign states\" and a referendum on independence later in the year while Klaus preached confederation. Finally the two agreed on a split with two independent republics. In October Meciar suddenly made a u-turn offering a new plan for union. Klaus declared against confederation in any form. Finally, in November Czech and Slovak parliaments voted for two separate republics effective Jan. 1, 1993. After twelve months of independence the Czech republic continued on the road to a free market economy with spreading cynicism over corruption among the business and political elite. The Slovak republic remained in deep recession with inflation above 25% and unemployment at 14% and rising. The Hungarian minority was demanding autonomy and according to polls 60% of Slovaks would prefer the former Czechoslovak federation. Democracy had suffered in both countries.", "In Czechoslovakia's 1992 elections, Slovaks voted to seek a looser confederation between the Czech and Slovak republics. Czechs voted for continued \"federation\". Two weeks later, \"confederation\" efforts failed, after Slovaks threatened extra-legal succession. Czech and Slovak leaders agreed to break up Czechoslovakia. Months later, Czech anti-succession MPs pressed for a \"union' between the proposed sovereign republics. Slovak officials first supported then repudiated \"union\", after Czech officials threatened extra-legal succession. The national parliament passed law allowing the republican parliaments to decide on separation, without needing a previously required national referendum. The two parliaments passed a joint resolution authorizing an interim government leading to separation on January 1, 1993, which the Czechoslovak parliament endorsed. Difficult but always civil negotiations distributed civil and military assets, based on a 2:1 population ratio. After separation, currencies split. Free movement of goods and people was permitted. Czechs took Czechoslovakia's foreign and domestic debt, but their rapidly privatizing economy invited EC investments, supplies and markets. A new nuclear reactor replaced expensive, polluting coal. Tourism increased. After one year, Slovakia was in deep recession. Inflation was over 25%. Unemployment soared. 100,000 Slovaks changed to Czech citizenship. Slovakia's slow privatization discouraged investors. Slovakia conducted a mini-arms race with Hungary, while its outdated steel and military equipment industries needed Hungarian ore. Ethnic Hungarians demanded autonomy. Slovakia lost Czech and ComEcon markets. The EC imposed anti-dumping measures on Slovak steel. Cheap skilled labor did attract joint ventures with Austria. Tourism could increase. Poland and Hungary created free-trade zones with both republics."]}

They also believe that all Americans deserve equal treatment regardless of their sexual orientation. Gays and socially moderate Republicans want their party to take a softer line on gay rights issues. Religious conservative Republicans view gays as maintaining a deviant life style that subverts religious and family values. About 5% of voters in 1996 identified themselves as gay. Republicans ceded them to the Democrats who courted gay voters for years. In the decades before the 2000 presidential election, the religious right set the social agenda for the Republican Party, which continued to be hostile to gays at both the local and national levels. In 1996, Republican nominee Bob Dole returned a $1,000 donation from the Log Cabin Republicans, an organization of gay and lesbian party supporters. In 1998, the Texas Republican Party denied recognition at its convention to the Log Cabin Republicans. The group held their own convention two months later to challenge the Republican Party to come to terms with their gay and lesbian members. In the 2000 presidential campaign, the Republican candidates signaled an openness to gay supporters, including a willingness to appoint them to positions like ambassadorships. The low-key, more inclusive approach was intended to appeal beyond the conservative base of the party to Democratic voters, especially those unhappy with the Clinton administration's record on gay issues. It also reflected the growing political influence of gay donors and voters.", "The conflicted relationship between the Republican party and the homosexual community is most clearly illustrated in the 2000 political convention when openly gay Representative Jim Kolbe, was invited to speak on the topic of free trade. The social conservative wing of the party was extremely critical of his appearance at the podium, although Kolbe never mentioned his sexual orientation in his brief speech. Social conservatives, after objecting to his appearance, bowed their heads in prayer during his talk. On the other hand, Log Cabin Republicans, gay members of the party, saw Kolbe's appearance as an historic event and a symbol of the inclusiveness of the party. GOP presidential nominees and gays in the party have had a stormy history of rejection. However, during the 2000 primary election season, candidates were aware of the need to court the gay and lesbian voting block, 5% of the electorate. John McCain collected tens of thousands of dollars from members of a gay Republican group in spite of disagreeing on many issues such as gay marriage. All candidates claimed that they would have no qualms hiring qualified homosexuals for government jobs. On first invitation, candidate George W. Bush refused to meet with Log Cabin executive director, Rich Tafel, but later agreed to a meeting, vowing to bring minority groups into the Republican fold. The 2000 Republican platform itself was strongly anti-gay objecting to any role for gays in the military and to the proposed expansion of federal civil rights law to cover homosexuals.", "Gay men and lesbians may be born homosexual, but they aren't born Democrats! The Republican Party is often seen as conducting an anti-gay campaign to court the religious right and win votes. However, Republican oratory has been growing more moderate since the 1992 vote, at which time large blocks of gay voters may have made a difference in several states. In the recent past, Republican Congressional leaders have called homosexuality a sin. Candidates vowed to block gay marriage and called homosexuality a threat. The Log Cabin Republicans, \"a sober-sided club of gay Republicans\", were denied recognition at the Texas Republican convention. In 1999 prominent Republican presidential candidates were signaling openness to gays, taking a low-key, inclusive approach. Two conservative icons, Ward Connerly and Arianna Huffington, showed support for gays and rebuked the party conservatives for their vitriolic comments. Alphonse D'Amato (R-NY) risked angering his conservative base by meeting with leaders of several major gay organizations. A first time meeting of the RNC with Log Cabin Republicans is planned and party spokesman Mike Collins expressed the need for mutual support between the party and gays who share their values and goals. A homosexual congressman (Kolbe, R-Ariz) was invited to speak at the 2000 GOP convention. Presidential front-runner George Bush conducted a post-primary meeting with GOP gays. He expresses qualifications, not sexual orientation, as being the significant factor in appointments, but he has opposed initiatives of importance to the gay community, such as same-sex marriages, gay adoption, and expanded anti-hate crime laws.", "The relationship between homosexuals and the Republican Party has long been strained. The issue of homosexual rights is divisive for the GOP because it diverts attention from other issues and puts candidates at odds with both gay rights advocates and religious conservatives. Anti-gay rhetoric and legislation sponsored by social conservatives in the GOP has often come off as mean-spirited. Patrick Buchanan's 1996 call for a \"cultural war\" against gay rights advocates and the GOP stance against same-sex marriage, gays in the military, and express legal protection for homosexuals has alienated gay voters. The Log Cabin Republicans, a gay political group, have had a particularly complicated relationship within the GOP. The Texas Republican Party denied them recognition at its 1999 convention, calling them deviant and likening them to the KKK. A spokesman stated that the Texas Republicans' platform was against homosexuality. Although religious conservatives continued to rally against gay issues, the GOP has softened its tone on the subject. Campaigning for the 2000 elections, Republican candidates created a more inviting atmosphere to homosexual voters. They used more moderate rhetoric and showed a new openness and receptivity toward gay supporters. Republican candidates met with leaders of major gay organizations to ask for their support. For the first time, the chairman of the Republican National Committee met with the Log Cabin Republicans. Gay Republican congressman Jim Kolbe spoke at the GOP national convention, something seen by gays as a historic event. As the Republican presidential candidate, Bush met with Texas Log Cabin Republicans."]}

What is the frequency of occurrence?", "summaries": ["Autism is a complex developmental disease that affects the normal development of the brain. It affects between 1 out of 500 and 1 out of 1000 children. More than 400,000 people in the US suffer from autism. Some scientific evidence suggests that the incidence of autism is growing. No one knows the cause of autism. Research suggests that there are multiple causes and that some interaction between genetic and environmental factors causes brain development to go wrong. Autism is thought to occur early in pregnancy. People with autism have a limited ability to communicate and a lack of response to others. Signs of autism appear during the first three years of life. Early diagnosis has long been a goal. Researchers discovered that abnormal body movements in children as young as three months can indicate autism. An important research breakthrough was the discovery that abnormal levels of four brain chemicals in newborn babies are biological markers for those who will develop autism. Affected babies could be treated by giving them special early enrichments or drugs designed to help their brain develop more normally. The widely accepted and demanded treatment is \"Applied Behavioral Analysis\" (ABA), a form of intensive one-on-one coaching. Other treatments include using hormone therapy with secretin, megavitamins, and special diets. Some school districts provide special education services for autistic children, including sending them to private institutions where ABA is used. A study in 2000 indicated that support services for autistic children and adults fall short of fulfilling their needs.", "Diagnosis of autism is based on observation of communication, behavior and development. Signs appear during the first three years, including oddly uncoordinated movements of babies. Autistic children have brain differences and tend to have bigger heads. A third suffer gastrointestinal problems. Their blood has abnormally high levels of four proteins. The only widely accepted treatment is applied behavioral analysis, involving repetitive teaching that breaks learning into incremental tasks with positive reinforcement. Early intervention has best results. Only half of children respond well. Repeated treatments with the digestive hormone secretin and antibiotic vancomycin have had positive results. Drugs sometimes control aggressive and self-destructive behavior. Research has involved MRIs, establishment of gene and tissue banks, and breeding of Guinea pigs with autistic abnormalities. Also studied are videos of autistic babies and bowel problem connections. The University of Washington leads in autism research. Autism is caused by interference in brain development from interactions between genes on Chromosomes 7, 13, and 15 and environmental factors, either during pregnancy or after birth. The broad spectrum of symptoms suggests multiple causes. Sex hormone influence explains the preponderance of boys. Suggested triggers include milk or wheat allergies, viruses, environmental toxins, maternal drugs, and peptides created by digestive problems. Support services are expensive and insufficient. New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania have superior programs. Autism affects 1 in 500-1000 and is on the rise. Eighty percent are boys. Odds are 1 in 20 that a family with one autistic child will have another. Brick, NJ has an autism cluster.", "It is thought that autism is caused by neurological abnormalities in parts of the brain. Scientists now suspect mutations of at least 5 or 6 genes on chromosomes 7, 13, and 15, possibly occurring in days 20-24 of gestation. Although autism is thought to occur in one out of 250-100 children, the true rate is questionable because there has never been a nationwide study. There are not enough facilities to support the number of autistics and there families and the treatment is expensive. Many families form their own support groups. New methods of diagnosing autism include blood testing newborns; children who later develop autism have abnormally high levels of four brain chemicals. Other signs include subtle abnormalities in body movements of infants as young as 3 months old. \"Applied Behavioral Analysis\" (ABA) is the only widely accepted treatment for autism. It uses repetitive teaching and positive reinforcement. It is hoped that intervention can be used to stimulate a baby's brain to circumvent\"bad wiring\" or develop compensatory connections, and the goal of research is to learn how and when to use intervention. Secretin, a hormone used for gastrointestinal problems, and the antibiotic vancomycin were accidentally found to lessen the characteristics of autism. Scientists are trying to identify different areas of the brain with different symptoms, and attempts are being made to correlate different areas of brain abnormality with outcome of interventions. New research shows a possible connection between sex hormones and brain development and susceptibility to neurological disorders.", "The incidence of autism, or at least the volume of reported cases of autism, has been on the rise. Between 1979 and 1999 the proportion of children in the U.S. affected by the malady increased from 4 or 5 per 10,000 to 1 in 500 or 1000. In England the increase was from 1-4 per 10,000 to 12 per 10,000. Research in 2000 involving neurochemistry, epidemology and analytical immunochemistry produced a reliable method of diagnosis at birth, but no \"miracle drug\" or pharmaceutical cure for the affliction has been developed. The method of diagnosis is based upon the abnormally high levels of four brain chemicals in the blood of newborns. It has not been established what causes these elevated levels although a combination of genetic factors and environmental influences is suspected. Early diagnosis improves chances of success with the only proven treatment: prolonged repeated brain stimulation in tiny increments through Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA). If ABA is administered beginning by age 2 or 3 and given for at least 25 hours/week in one-on-one sessions for two or three years, 50% of afflicted children respond well with an average IQ increase of 28 points. Aside from hospitals and clinics, some non-profit groups proved ABA services and carry on further research on autism. The Cure Autism Now Foundation has established a gene bank for genetic research based on 465 families with more than one autistic child."]}

What other disorders are related to OCD?", "summaries": ["Signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are preoccupation with details, rules, lists, order, organization or schedules; perfectionism; excessive devotion to work and productivity; inability to discard worn out or worthless objects; and being over-conscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible. Symptoms include panic attacks, obsessive thoughts, flashbacks, nightmares, and frightening physical symptoms. Hallmarks are senseless and repetitive thoughts and behaviors that typically deal with grooming, contamination, or danger. Examples are excessive hand washing or wringing, constant fidgeting, twitching, discomfort in crowds, or repeated checking to make sure doors are locked. Anxiety disorders can be treated through targeted psychotherapy or medications. Drugs work best when combined with cognitive or behavioral psychotherapy. Drugs approved for use with OCD are sertraline (Zoloft); clomipramine (Anafranil); and the antidepressant fluvoxamine (Luvox). Clomipramine's side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, and constipation. The antidepressant fluoxetine (Prozac) also works but may make people feel they have lost part of themselves. Prozac's other side effects include sexual dysfunction and sleeplessness. Paxil (also FDA-approved for treating OCD), Prozac and Zoloft are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and take several weeks to become effective. Fluorextine is being tested for OCD use. Half of OCD children respond to drug treatment. A possible OCD treatment is implantation of electrodes into the thalamus to break abnormal oscillation patterns. OCD sufferers often have overlapping problems with depression, anxiety, or eating or body dysmorphic disorders. OCD is in the class of anxiety disorders, which also include panic, post-traumatic stress, and phobias such as social phobia. Animal hoarding may involve OCD.", "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by senseless repetitive thoughts and behaviors, which typically deal with grooming, contamination, or danger. Sufferers may wash their hands continually or repeatedly check their appearance in mirrors. They are nervous and frequently fidget and twitch. The diagnostic manual of the American Psychiatric Association states sufferers are preoccupied with details, rules, order, or schedules to the extent that the point of the activity is lost. They show perfectionism that interferes with task completion. They are over-conscientious and inflexible. They are devoted to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships. They may be unable to discard worthless objects. OCD is one of a related group of anxiety disorders. Other illnesses in this group include panic attacks, post-traumatic stress, generalized anxiety disorders, phobias, animal hoarding, and body dysmorphic disorder. OCD victims may also suffer from anorexia and depression. There is some evidence that these disorders, along with tinnitus and Parkinson's disease, stem from the same brain defect--a decoupling of two brain regions that normally work in synchrony. If true, implanting electrodes may provide relief. Treatment consists of medications, psychotherapy, or a combination of the two. Effective drugs include serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as flouxetine (Prozac), sertarline (Zoloft), clomipramine (Anafranil), and fluvoxamine (Luvox). Each has varying effectiveness and side effects. Several are effective with children who have OCD. The most successful psychotherapy appears to be cognitive-behavioral therapy, where the patient learns to moderate moods by manipulating his thoughts in a certain direction.", "Obsessive-compulsive disorder, (OCD) is one of many anxiety disorders with emotional, psychological, and biological underpinnings and can be treated through targeted psychotherapy, medications, or a combination of the two. OCD affects 2% of adults but the first signs often appear in childhood. Symptoms are senseless and repetitive thoughts and behaviors that typically deal with grooming, contamination, or danger. An example is excessive hand-washing. Animal hoarding (keep excessive pets) may be a symptom. Three similar drugs which have worked well on children in large trials are sertraline (marketed as Zoloft), clomiprimane (marketed as Anafranil), and fluvoxamine (marketed as Luvox). They all buoy brain levels of serotonin, a chemical messenger between nerves. Also, the anti-depressant fluoxetine, marketed as Prozac, has worked well in small trials on childhood OCD. Paxil, another drug used for OCD, is from a class of psychiatric drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that includes Prozac and Zoloft. Cognitive Therapy, the moderation of our moods by manipulating our thoughts, has shown to be useful for treating OCD. Sufferers of OCD often have overlapping problems with depression, eating disorders, or other anxiety disorders, such as panic attacks and BDD (body dysmorphic disorder). One theory is that OCD, depression, tinnitus, chronic pain, and Parkinson's symptoms (shaking and immobility) all stem from the same basic brain defect -- a decoupling of two brain regions that normally fire their cells in symmetry.", "The symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder are obsessive thoughts and compulsive repetitive behaviors, to include excessive and debilitating preoccupation with details or rules, excessive perfectionism, excessive devotion to work, and over-conscientiousness and inflexibility about morals, ethics, or values. OCD is successfully treated with antidepressant drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors which block the reabsorption of the chemical serotonin in brain cells. These drugs include Prozac (fluoxetine), Zoloft (sertraline), Anafranil (clomipramine), Luvox (fluvoxamine), and Paxil. They must be taken for several weeks before patients will see a marked improvement. Anafranil, Zoloft and Luvox are approved to treat OCD in children and adults. Studies show Prozac to be safe for children, too. Cognitive-behavioral therapy has proven to be as effective as drugs in treating OCD. Patients treated with cognitive therapy show the same biological changes in brain function as do those treated with medications. Brain function changes resulting from cognitive therapy last longer because they become part of the individual. Anxiety disorders like panic, phobias, and post-traumatic stress are related to OCD, as are depression, anorexia, bulimia, body dysmorphic disorder, and animal hording. They are often treated with the same medications. One theory holds that the same underlying brain defect causes many of the disorders. According to the theory, the disorders arise when part of the thalamus oscillates out of sync with the cortex. Based on this, it is believed that OCD might be treated by implanting targeted electrodes into the thalamus, in a method similar to a treatment for Parkinson's disease."]}

How successful is online bookselling and how has it affected traditional sellers?", "summaries": ["Independent booksellers have had great difficulty competing against the major chain stores, Barnes & Noble and Borders Books and online giant, Amazon. In the 1990s, membership in the American Bookseller Association, which represents the independent stores, dropped by almost half, as bookstores were forced to close their doors. The remaining membership has been devising strategies to keep businesses solvent. Some shops cater to niche markets, others entice customers with special service and community events. By 1999, independent booksellers held only a 17 percent market share. Furthermore, overall sale of adult trade books fell. In 1998, Barnes & Nobel announced acquisition of Ingram Book Group, the nation's largest distributor of books. The announcement sent panic through the ABA. They feared that the merger would drive them out of business. They began an opposition campaign with appeals to the FTC, accusing Barnes & Noble of unfair trade practices. The FTC concluded that the planned merger violated antitrust law and recommended that the commission step in to block it. To face competition from online marketing, the ABA has created its own online store for independent booksellers, Book Sense. Book Sense provides links to independent stores. The ABA also challenged the Barnes & Noble's advertising claim, \"If we don't have your book, nobody does,\" as misleading, asking for the claim to be discontinued. California sellers urged that state to collect taxes on major online retailers such as Amazon. Many small booksellers developed websites to have an online presence for advertising and selling their books.", "Bookselling is changing dramatically. Big chains are proliferating and squeezing out independent bookstores. Independents lost half their market share in six years and many have closed. Most books are now sold in nontraditional outlets, including discount stores and the internet. The American Bookseller Association represents private bookstore owners and sponsors Book Expo, an annual convention. The ABA brought antitrust suits against top publishing houses and Borders and Barnes & Noble for making secret deals that undercut independents, resulting in a $25 million payment by publishers to booksellers. It censured author Frank McCourt for participating in chainstore advertising, challenged barnesandnoble.com's claim \"If we don't have your book nobody does,\" led successful opposition to B&N's plan to purchase the largest book distributor (threatening independents with reduced service and compromised records), and joined the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association in urging collection of taxes from on-line bookstores. To meet online competition, the ABA opened Book Sense and Contentville, online selling and commentary sites serving as hubs for individual stores. Online book sales captured 2% of the market in 1999 and were projected to rise to 10% by 2002 and 18% by 2003. Online competition led barnesandnoble.com to sell shares to the public, B&N and Amazon to establish their own distribution centers to increase profits, and barnesandnoble.com and borders.com to match amazon.com in halving best-seller prices. Online sales hurt mail-order and book club sales. To stay competitive, traditional booksellers increased personal service, sponsored special events, and began selling online and offering broad search capabilities.", "A new industry study in early 1999 indicates that the popular market for literature declined almost three percent, with the number of purchases dropping for the first time in several years. A total of $1.04 billion books were purchased with retail sales reaching $12.3 billion, although Americans bought 30 million fewer books in 1998. About one-half of the book sales were generated by major chain stores and electronic bookstores. Independent bookstores' market sales dropped from 16.6 percent to 15.2 percent in 1999. Independent bookstores have been seriously damaged by superstore chains and also have been set back by increasing online sales. Their portion of the book market was cut in half during this decade and membership in their trade organization, the American Booksellers Association (ABA) dropped from 5,200 to 3,500. Studies show that books sold online tripled their market share between 1998 and 1999. Adults purchased over 50 million titles online and that number is expected to increase significantly in the next year. Independent booksellers, after a two-decade war against chains and online booksellers, are seeking to gain ground in a number of ways, including appeals to the FTC. The ABA will introduce two large-scale Web sites. The first is Booksense.com, a \"hub site\" for hundreds of individual sites created and maintained by local stores. The second will be Contentville, in which about 40 of the most respected booksellers will provide editorial comment. Book clubs are being revived by a merger between Time, Inc. and the German-owned Bartelsmann Doubleday Direct.", "Bookselling in the United States changed dramatically in the 1990s. Independent booksellers have been the hardest hit by the changes. In 1991, the independents claimed nearly a third of adult book purchases but six years later their market share was nearly cut in half, down to 17%. The American Booksellers Association (ABA) that represents the independents saw its membership drop from 5,200 to less than 3,500. Large chain booksellers like Barnes & Noble and Borders did increase market share by 3% during this same period but they too faced increasing challenges from price clubs and especially from online booksellers such as Amazon. The ABA was formed to represent and promote the independent booksellers. They filed suit against Barnes&Noble when it made a bid to acquire the leading book wholesaler Ingram Book Group. That bid was later dropped because of opposition from the Federal Trade Commission but had it gone through, Barnes&Noble could have optimized its own position by preferential channeling of book distribution through its stores to the detriment of the independents. Online bookselling continued to increase its share of the book market. The chains and independents have also established online sites. Barnes&Noble established an online venture that in at least one year lost money. The Independents also established its own national online store, Book Sense, to stave off fierce competition from Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com. They also formed Bookfinder.com to permit online browsing of inventories of thousands of independent bookshops."]}
{"id": "D446J", "query": "What impacts have attacks on tourists had on a government's economy? What steps have authorities taken to decrease these attacks? What tactics have authorities and businesses tried to lessen the impacts?", "summaries": ["Two countries where attacks on tourism are seriously affecting the local economies are Egypt and Kenya. In Egypt, the death of nine people and injury to some three hundred others in 1992-1993 from Islamic militants has been a severe blow to the tourist industry. Hotel bookings are way down, airline services are declining, and tourism employees fear loss of their jobs. The Egyptian government has launched a massive campaign to promote tourist safety. Helicopters patrol over tourist areas and thousands of police and paramilitary personnel are aggressively assaulting terrorist hideouts. Many of the captured terrorists receive immediate publicized death sentences. Egypt is increasing religious broadcasting to demonstrate the regime is more devout than the radical opposition. The government also has begun an aggressive marketing campaign, hiring two renowned public relations companies to promote Egypt's fairer face. Large tracts of coastline are being developed in the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Sinai areas away from traditional holiday haunts, while the country's obvious treasures are widely advertised. Kenya is experiencing a high level of crime against tourists which is causing a sharp drop in tourism there, seriously reducing hard currency revenues from the industry. Hotel bookings are way down as a consequence. Kenya badly needs tourists to help purchase essential imports. The government is fighting back with a vigorous campaign to revitalize the industry and woo visitors. Security in national parks will be stepped up, more roads built, security networks will be set up, and stricter licensing of drivers will be enforced.", "Egypt's economy was seriously damaged by terrorist attacks on tourists from 1992 to 1994. These attacks endangered the multi-billion dollar industry. Tours were cancelled; attractions, hotels, and resorts were empty; and foreign commitments to privatization projects were down. To stop these attacks Egypt declared an all-out war on the Islamic fundamentalists responsible. Hundreds to thousands were rounded up and at least nine were hanged. Mosques came under state control and the state began religious broadcasts. Aircraft, police, and troops were deployed to Upper Egypt. Police guarded restaurants and hotels. For a 1994 international conference, police lined the streets and hotels became military encampments. To reduce the impact of the attacks, the tourism minister became more visible to the world. Two public relations firms were hired and tourists were warned of areas to avoid. Egyptian officials also chided western press for over blowing the attacks. Tourism in Kenya also dropped after 1992 crimes against tourists. Revenues dropped by one quarter. Kenyan officials began aerial surveillance of game parks and issued warnings on dangerous areas. In Russia in 1989, crime was up in prime tourist cities bringing special police forces and tourist warnings. Attacks in Western nations seemed to have less impact; in 1992 and 1993, however, deaths of nine European tourists in Florida did put the state in a tailspin. Bookings and trips were cancelled. Some stocks fell. The state cancelled its ad campaign, established rewards, requested federal help, increased road patrols, guarded rest stops, and issued safety tips.", "Third world countries suffer more from attacks on tourists than developed countries because of a perception they are societies under siege. 1993's Islamic militant targeting of Egypt's tourism, its biggest foreign currency earner and contributor of 6% of its GDP, cost $900 million in lost revenues. Earnings and bookings fell 20%. New investment projects dried up. Publicity surrounding attacks on tourists in Kenya caused hard currency revenue to drop from $400 million in 1991 to $295 million in 1992. Kenya depends on tourism for purchasing essential imports and servicing a $7.1 billion foreign date. Tourist murders cost Florida's tourism, its largest industry, nearly $1 billion. A 15-25% decline was projected but not a catastrophic impact. Investment was not deterred although stocks of related companies declined. The International Federation of Tour Operators advised countries not to cover up crimes against tourists but rather take clearly effective measures. Home and host governments and travel agents advised visitors on dangerous practices and areas to avoid. Egypt rounded up thousands of militants and sentenced 21 to death, intensified security wherever tourists were, and attempted to co-opt Islamicists. It began marketing tourism aggressively. Kenya instituted aerial surveillance of game parks. Florida increased surveillance of highways, rest areas, and the Miami area; strengthened searches for lost tourists; and advised travelers about safety precautions. It cancelled tourism advertising campaigns. The Soviet Union established a special police force to deal with crimes against foreigners, increased surveillance at tourist spots, and warned tourists against black market dealings and taxis.", "The impacts on Egypt's economy from terrorist attacks on tourists were a 20 to 50 percent decline in Egypt's multi-billion dollar tourism industry -- 20 percent of Egypt's foreign currency, 8 percent of gross domestic product, one of every 15 jobs; an interruption of 17.5 percent annual tourism growth; and a halt to new tourism facility investments. Egyptair postponed purchase of three A340 airliners. To decrease these attacks Egypt gave moderate Islamicists greater recognition, put all mosques under state control, increased religious broadcasting on state-owned media, while waging war on terrorists and increasing hangings of Islamic militants. To decrease tourism impacts Egypt launched public relations campaigns, promoted safer areas, and increased tourist site security. Kenyan tourist revenues dropped from $400m to $295m due to bandit attacks on tourists and tribal violence. Kenya established a tourist police force, stricter licensing of drivers, and extensive park security. Kenya advised tourists about dangerous areas of Nairobi, built more roads, and improved accommodations. In 1993 the murder of nine foreign visitors in Florida caused a 15-25 percent downturn in tourism, Florida's largest industry with 22 percent of spending, impacting tourism-related stocks and developments. 1993 loses approached $1b. Florida issued rewards, increased police patrols on highways and rest stops, and issued tourist safety information. Florida cancelled its domestic and international tourism campaigns and emphasized destinations away from Miami. Street crime in the Soviet Union in 1989 threatened tourist revenues. The Soviets created a tourist crimes police force and warned against dangerous illegal foreign exchange operators."]}

What are the reactions of both parties and of the international community?", "summaries": ["Since the 1967 war, Israel has occupied the Arab territory of the West Bank (and also Arab East Jerusalem). Settlement expansion in those areas is one of the most sensitive disputes in the Israeli-Palestine peace talks. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu calls the settlements \"natural growth\". However, Knesset member Yossi Sarid (Labor party) says settlement activity is the biggest enemy of peace process. While many Israelis welcome decisions to ease the resrictions on Jewish settlement, Israel's Arab community plans to boycott settlement goods. Conversely, settlement leaders threaten to stop employing Arabs in the settlements. Peace Now is an Israeli group who oppose the expansion and monitor the number of housing units. They accuse their government of having no thought to the consequences. Peace Now calls for evacuation of certain settlements. It's Israelis versus Israelis as Peace Now visitors and settlers skirmish! Yee-ha! Palestinians are infuriated by Netanyahu's pledge of more settlements. Palestinian leaders accused the Israeli settlement policy of hampering the establishment of a Palestinian state. They condemned Israel and called on Palestinians to continue fighting against the settlements. Jordan and Egypt say the settlements pose a threat to the peace process. The Clinton administration expressed concern over settlement expansion plans. Previously they had been ok with expansion of existing settlements but not with building of new settlements. The EU expressing disapproval by announcing plans to boycott settlement products via heavy fines. The U.N. Genral Assembly calls for a meeting to urge Switzerland to enforce a ban on settlement activities.", "Israeli settlements on the West Bank have had a strongly negative impact on the progress of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Under moderate leadership Israel's government in 1992 announced a freeze on construction in Jewish settlements on the West Bank but the ban was revoked in mid-1996 when the right-wing Likud government came to power. As Israeli-Palestinian peace talks progressed, expansion of settlements became one of the most sensitive disputes and talks were stalled after Israel broke ground for the Har Homa settlement in March 1997. Israel argued that expansion of existing settlements was a normal and necessary result of population growth while Palestinians declared it a violation of peace accords. In November 1998, five days after the Israeli Knesset ratified the peace accord, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon encouraged settlers to grab as much land as they could before Israel began its troop pullback. Palestinian officials called Sharon's statement a declaration of war. In 1999 the Ehud Barak administration pledged no new settlements, but expansion continued. By December 1999 Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks were suspended over ongoing settlement activities. The United States government maintained for two decades that the West Bank settlements were illegal and destructive of the peace process, as did Egypt, Jordan and the Israeli activist group Peace Now. The European Union and the U.N. General Assembly opposed the settlements including a charge that they violated the Fourth Geneva Convention banning usurpation of land by an occupying power.", "In the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan, Gaza and the Sinai from Egypt, and the Golan Height from Syria. Following their capture, Israel established settlements in these territories, as did successive Israeli governments. By late 1998, some 150,000 Jewish settlers lived in 173 settlements scattered across the West Bank. The West Bank, which contains many important Jewish religious and historical sites, was viewed by Israel as militarily vital. Palestinians complained that Israeli settlements broke up the territories between their main cities, isolated Jerusalem, and diminished their chances of establishing a future independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. They regarded continuing settlement construction as illegal land grabs, inconsistent with peace accords signed by the two sides. Israel defended settlement expansion as necessary to accommodate rising housing demand caused by natural growth of the settler population. Countries such as Jordan viewed new settlements as posing a threat to the Arab-Israeli peace process. The Israeli \"Peace Now\" movement opposed new settlements and advocated withdrawal of Israelis from most of the West Bank in exchange for peace with the Palestinians. The United States expressed concern that Israeli settlement expansion could erode confidence between Israelis and Palestinians and could hamper peace making between them. The European Union asked its members to boycott settlement products from Israel by imposing heavy custom duties. Delegates to a U.N. conference urged Israel to halt new construction of Jewish settlements in the disputed territories, claiming such activities violate the Fourth Geneva Convention.", "During the late 1990s, there were over 200,000 Israeli settlers living in about 180 settlements on the West Bank, creating tensions between the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli government and interfering with ongoing peace talks between the two groups. The Israeli government under Netanyahu encouraged settlements by issuing more building permits, giving tax breaks to settlers, setting aside government funds for expansion, and giving city status to the settlement of Ariel. There was a great outcry of opposition from the Palestinian Authority, the United States, the European Union, and even within Israel where peace groups protested repeatedly. The Clinton administration stated that the issue of settlements was the major obstacle to a successfully negotiated peace and a reversal of Israeli assurances regarding settlements. The EU placed a heavy custom duty on products from the West Bank, claiming that the settlements were occupied territory and not part of Israel. In late 1998, the Sharon government agreed to a pullout from settlements in the West Bank, but first encouraged Israeli settlers to grab as much territory as they could before the negotiations began. This plan was sharply criticized by the US. At the same time however, Israeli police began the removal of one group of remote hilltop settlers. In 1999, the United Nations condemned the still continuing expansion of Israeli settlements, calling it a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Newly elected Prime Minister Barak pledged to move peace talks forward and halt the building of settlements, but little has changed."]}

Are judges claiming to be sending any messages to other would-be criminals in their sentencing practices?", "summaries": ["Perpetrators of white collar crimes sometimes get off easy. But several cases in 1989 and 1990 illustrate the opposite: Barry Minkow, who built a fraudulent $100-million empire, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud and conspiracy, plus payment of $26 million in restitution. Janet Faye McKinzie was convicted of looting the now-defunct North America Savings & Loan. She was sentenced to 20 years in jail. A Los Angeles federal judge imposed a 15-year prison sentence on David A. Feldman, convicted of a massive bank fraud, and ordered him to pay $70.7 million in restitution to Bank of America. A federal judge sentenced a stunned Michael Milken to 10 years in prison. Milken had pleaded guilty to six felony securities law violations. A federal judge sentenced political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. to 15 years in prison on mail and tax fraud convictions. Leona Helmsley, the self-proclaimed queen of a luxury hotel chain, was sentenced to four years in federal prison and fined $7.1 million for criminal tax offenses. On the other hand, a former executive of Digital Equipment Corp. and two others pleaded guilty for siphoning nearly $300,000 from the company and agreed to repay the money in lieu of a prison term. An Irvine, California, city councilman who forged a check for $48,000, was put on one-year's probation, given a year's suspended jail sentence, and ordered to perform community service. Six New Jersey defendants, convicted of racketeering, were sentenced to only a few months in prison.", "In a security fraud case, Michael Milken was sentenced to10 years in prison. In an investment fraud case, Barry Minkow was given a 25-year prison term for defrauding investors of tens of millions of dollars; in another case, a top investment firm executive was sentenced to10 years. In a case of illegally profiting from insider trading, the convicted received a two-year sentence; in another case, a firm was heavily fined. Two of those convicted in the collapse of a West Coast savings and loan received sentences of 27 years between them and ordered to pay $6.8 million in restitution. In another savings and loan case, the convicted received a 20-year sentence. In a massive bank fraud case, David Feldman received a 15-year sentence and ordered to pay $71 million in restitution. A financial advisor received a 4-year sentence for diverting investors' money for personal use. A tax advisor received 10 years for organizing a bogus tax shelter scheme. Leona Helmsley received four years for tax fraud. Prosecutions tended to be more aggressive and sentences tended to be longer for financial crimes with many victims and massive losses of money, as in the Minkow case. Those responsible for the collapse of savings and loans also received heavy sentences. Judges often ordered the convicted to pay restitution. Those convicted of insider trading, a victimless crime, was treated less harshly. The judge in the Milken case said that the 10-year sentence she imposed on Milken was intended to make an example of him.", "Individuals convicted of so-called white-collar crimes such as felony forgery, mail fraud, tax fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, investment fraud, securities fraud, pension fraud, embezzlement and grand theft are no longer getting by with a slap on the wrist. Judges are increasingly imposing stiff sentences and levying stiff fines as deterrents. Those on the margin of a fraudulent scheme may sometimes escape with a very short sentence such as 30 days. Some of the white-collar criminals escape prison by paying a heavy fine and making restitution. Increasingly harsh sentences for some of those found guilty have included a multi-year prison term, plus several years of probation during which community service is to be performed, plus a stiff fine and also restitution may be required. This dramatic increase in the length of prison terms is part of a nationwide trend beginning with the savings and loan scandal. One judge said that the nearly half million dollar fine he levied on a specialist firm on the New York Stock Exchange was done as a deterrent. Prison sentences have ranged as high as 25 years. Fines and restitution requirements have been in the millions of dollars. Having a widely recognized name in the business world has not saved Leona Helmsley, Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken from doing time.", "With the revelation of large-scale corporate and financial crimes there has been a growing tendency to prosecute such violations with criminal rather than civil charges including use of the RICO statute targeted against organized crime. With criminal charges, sentences became harsher with prison terms in addition to fines, hefty restitutions and probation with community service. Judges made it clear that profiteering from illegal financial dealings must be treated as a serious felony to deter others from following the same course. Rudolph W. Giuliani as a prosecutor launched an unprecedented wave of criminal cases against major Wall Street figures before becoming Mayor of New York City. In one of his cases the judge who presided gave a very mild sentence finding that the offenses charged under the RICO statute were so minor that any harsher sentence would have amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. As more flagrant cases of financial shenanigans became known, the viewpoint of prosecutors and judges changed. In 1989 a prosecutor seeking a 25-year prison sentence and $26million in restitution in a financial fraud case was sustained by the judge. In 1990 in a savings and loan case the defendant received a 15-year prison sentence for massive bank fraud and was ordered to pay $70.7million in restitution. In a case of thrift fraud the penalty was 20 years in prison and $13.5 million in restitution. The penalty for financial crime had obviously grown.", "Sentencing for so-called \"white-collar\" financial crimes was more lenient than maximum federal sentencing guidelines until those guidelines were toughened in 1984. Also, there has been growing sentiment among judges that white-collar criminals should be treated the same as other criminals, especially in the light of savings and loan scandals emerging in the mid-1980s. It was 1990 before the first successful use of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) law to convict savings and loan fraud. RICO was enacted to prosecute illusive organized crime. Critics charge that pre-trial forfeiture of assets under RICO gives prosecutors too much power, and causes companies to go out of business before trial. Virtually any financial fraud can now become a RICO case. The Justice Department reported that 1990 saw \"a dramatic increase [nation-wide] in the length of [white-collar] sentences\". The harshest individual sentence was 25 years, and the largest penalty has been $650 million. White-collar sentences vary proportionate to the extent of financial harm, and according to each defendant's degree of knowing culpability and cooperation with prosecutors. Judges can impose any combination of prison time, fines, court costs, costs of incarceration, restitution, probation, suspended sentences and community service. Non-criminal remedies include injunctions, civil penalties, or civil litigation. Some judges have issued tough sentences, explicitly calling them a \"deterrent\" to other would-be criminals, such as \"The sentence will send a message to other savings and loan owners that white-collar crime doesn't pay\". But other judges' tough verbal warnings have not matched their more lenient sentences.", "By 1990 financial--or white-collar--crimes were beginning to draw heavier sentences. In 1986 a crooked investment banker got only 2 years in jail and an insider trader got 3 years. In 1989 Lyndon LaRouche drew a 15-year sentence, while Barry Minkow got 25 years and a $25 million restitution order. Leona Helmsly was given a 4-year sentence, a $7.1 million restitution, 3 years probation, 750 hours of public service, and ordered to pay her taxes. Michael Milken-- the junk bond king--drew 10 years in jail, 3 years probation, 1,800 hours of community service, and $600 million in fines. Savings and loan collapse criminals began to draw heavy jail sentences such as 20, 15, and 12 years. Not all got heavy sentences. One insurance embezzler got 30 days, 300 hours of public service, and a $10,000 fine. Executives of a computer company only were ordered to repay the money. White-collar criminals were beginning to get the same treatment as other criminals, even to include denying bail. Prosecutors were using the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act to go after white-collar crimes that had once been treated as civil cases. Sentences were stiffer for those convicted of thrift savings fraud. The average sentence was 3 years, with 78% being sent to prison. Sentences of 10 years or more were given to 25% of these criminals. Judges were calling white-collar crimes \"heinous\", denouncing liars, and imposing high fines as a deterrent, especially for those guilty of insider trading.", "Sentences being imposed for financial crimes such as fraud and embezzlement are imprisonment, fines, restitution to the victims, reparations to the government, probation, and community service. In most cases, sentences involve a combination of imprisonment, fines, and restitution. A light sentence for a first offender may call for a fine of a few thousand dollars, a few hundred hours of community service, restitution to victims, and avoidance of working in a capacity in which the accused would be responsible for other people's money. First time offenders usually face two to three years' imprisonment if victims' losses range from $200,000 to $1 million. If the fraud exceeds $1 million, recommended prison terms before parole would equal 40 to 52 months. Bilking a large number of people out of millions of dollars can lead to sentences that vary from ten to twenty years. Judges have not always believed that jail is a panacea and they hold the view that the punishment must fit the crime. In recent years, however, they are becoming increasingly severe in their sentencing in the wake of government and private business concerns about judges being soft on \"white-collar\" workers. In some of the longest term sentencing, judges are sending the message to would-be fraud criminals that the criminal system will no longer coddle white-collar offenders. Longer term sentences seem to reflect the courts growing understanding of the public's outcry on financial fraud cases. In one recent case, a judge noted the cynicism, ruthlessness, and deceit of the accused.", "It is difficult to discern a current trend in prosecuting financial crime a judges' decisions run from lenient to harsh. A city councilman pleaded guilty to felony forgery, but a superior court judge reduced the charge to a misdemeanor and ordered community service with probation. A city administrator pleaded guilty to mail fraud in a scheme that bilked investors out of $3 million, a crime which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, but a US District judge gave him only five years probation and ordered $20,000 in restitution. Political extremist Lyndon LaRouche was sentenced to 15 years in prison on a mail and tax fraud conviction that could have brought him 65 years. However, two businessmen whose fraud resulted in the collapse of a savings and loan were sentenced to 15 and 12 years and ordered to make restitution of $6.8 million. This was hailed by the prosecuting US attorney as a significant victory for the government in its efforts to punish those responsible for the savings and loan crisis. Certain judges have sent similar clear messages at sentencing. US Superior Court Judge Letts railed against the tolerance of some judges to white-collar crime as he sentenced a tax advisor to a 10-year prison term for orchestrating a multimillion-dollar tax shelter scheme. Other judges have imposed harsh penalties, stating their hope that they would act as deterrents. US District Judge Wood said the unexpectedly long prison term for Michael Milken was intended to make him an example.", "During the late 1980s and early 1990s there were many cases of financial crime brought to trial (in both the state and federal courts) including three very high profile cases: Leona Helmsley, accused of tax evasion, Michael Milkin, accused of insider trading on Wall Street, and the looting of the North American Savings & Loan Company most notably by Janet Faye McKinzie. Although there is no consistent pattern in sentencing, there was some tendency to impose harsher penalties on financial criminals than in previous years. In all three cases cited above, penalties included jail time of several years with no chance of parole in the first two to three years, financial penalties, restitution to those cheated, and community service hours. In some of the less known cases, penalties were less severe. The sentencing in the McKinzie case was part of a trend of stiff sentences for white-collar criminals involved in the savings and loan scandal. Some judges stated that they imposed harsh sentences to set an example to others. Other judges claimed that their purpose in sentencing was a response to the seriousness of the individual cases they were trying. On the other hand, in several instances, complaints about financial crimes to the US Department of Labor and other government agencies went unheeded. Labor ignored numerous complaints of pension plans being defrauded claiming they were too understaffed to respond. As a result, many workers discovered upon retirement that their pension money no longer existed."]}

In 1990, he became an advisor to Anatoly Sobchak, chairman of the Leningrad city council; and in 1992, he was appointed head of the External Relations Committee of the St. Petersburg mayor's office. In 1996, he was called to Moscow to serve in Yeltsin's administration. He was made director of the Federal Security Service, the successor agency to the KGB. In August 1999, Yeltsin nominated Putin as Russia's prime minister and his preferred successor as president. On December 31, 1999, Yeltsin, who was ailing and unpopular because of scandals and policy failures, unexpectedly resigned as Russia's president and named Putin as acting president. Presidential elections were scheduled for March 26, 2000. In his campaign, Putin promised to raise wages of state workers, boost pensions, improve education, and restore Russia to its past glory.

His main opponent was the chief of the Communist Party. Putin won the March 26 election with 53% of the vote. After his election he moved very cautiously.

Putin was popular for his vigorous image, tough handling of the war in Chechnya, and promises to fight official corruption. Putin moved cautiously after election. Other than not replacing Defense Minister Sergeyev, and visiting Belarus, Britain and Ukraine to emphasize ties with former Soviet republics and the West, Putin gave no indication of his leadership direction."]}

Some states are enacting laws to require seat belt usage and some auto makers are installing audio and visual signals to show when belts are not engaged. Seat belts are being improved and some are adjustable to accommodate the size of the user. Side and rear seat air bags are now available from many manufacturers in addition to front air bags. One maker offers a curtain-like side air bag to add a measure of safety during a rollover. Dual inflation levels for air bags are proposed since some bags inflating in low speed crashes have been blamed for killing several people, mostly children. Improperly installed child seats have been responsible for children injuries and fatalities. Some governmental units and some auto dealers are offering free advice and assistance in the proper installation of children's seats. Crash tests, including tests with dummies in the rear seats provide valuable information for safety planners. Researchers have suggested using \"black boxes\" in cars like those used in aircraft to record data pertinent to an auto crash to lead to safety improvements. Anti-lock brakes are a very important safety factor and some autos have adjustable pedals so that drivers are not too close to air bag deployment. Other safety devices in limited use are reverse sensing devices to warn of the closeness of objects behind the car and sensors to warn of low tire pressure.", "One of the earliest, and perhaps most effective, automobile safety devices is the seat belt. Its weakness lies in the failure of drivers and passengers to use it. It is estimated that in the United States the compliance rate is only 68 percent. In 2000 the state of New Jersey authorized police to stop and ticket drivers who are not wearing seat belts. Air bags were introduced in the 1980's and were credited with saving many lives. Dual front air bags became standard equipment, but they posed threats to children and small people. Air bags exerting less force were developed. Side-impact air bags were later introduced to protect against impact from the side of the vehicle. Child safety seats went through several steps in development but the variety of designs tended to mystify owners and many seats were installed incorrectly so as to be ineffective. In January 1999 the National Transportation Safety Board asked all states to set up \"fitting stations\" which could install and inspect child safety seats. Several electronic computer-controlled devices were produced to warn of or compensate for dangerous driving conditions, and record data on vehicle performance (\"black box\"). New Mexico in 1999 attacked automobile safety with a graduated licensing law requiring a learner's permit followed by an intermediate license, both with restrictions on night driving and number of young passengers aboard, and finally a full license if the driver has a clear record.", "Many automakers initially resisted the introduction of safety features, such as airbags, claiming they were unwanted by consumers. By the 1999 model year, many were offering safety features to help promote sales. Volvo luxury models featured computerized stability and traction control, advanced antilock braking, new seats offering improved whiplash protection in rear-end crashes, and an \"inflatable curtain,\" Volvo's version of a side airbag system to protect the driver and front passenger in side collisions. Mercedes-Benz sport utility models included Body-Smart, a system that deactivates the front passenger-side airbag if a child is in a booster seat in the front. The Rover Discovery Series offered a computer-assisted active cornering enhancement (ACE) to reduce the risk of rollover. Mercedes and BMW had airbag curtains that inflate across car windows and could help in rollovers. The Ford Windstar minivan offered a side airbag to protect front seat passengers in side impacts, and side airbags were provided in lower priced vehicles such as the Toyota Corolla. Some models came equipped with tires capable of running for some time after sustaining a flat, thereby letting the driver obtain help or find a safe place to change the tire. All wheel drive, which helps prevent a vehicle from skidding on snow or ice, became available from Subaro, Volvo, and Mercedes. New headlight systems designed to provide better lighting became available. DaimlerChrysler agreed to establish a permanent free service at some of its dealerships to advise parents on the correct way to install children's car seats.", "The seat belt is the most effective automobile safety device. Getting people to use them remains a problem, which has been addressed by installing use-sensors and enacting laws to stop and fine non-users. Airbags should protect, but not injure, the drivers and front seat passengers. Devices were installed to prevent their deployment when passengers are too small. Side airbags or curtains, again that can be deactivated, are being installed to prevent injuries in side collusions or rollovers. Additional interior cushioning is used to avoid head injuries and having the backrest and head restraint shift backward in a rear end collusion can provide whiplash protection. Infant car seats, child restraints, and booster seats, all placed in the back seat, are the keys to protecting children in a crash. Enforcing their use and programs to educate parents on the correct use and installation are key. Crash tests, finally beginning in China, should include child dummies in the back seat. Engineers are seeking ways to avoid the accident in the first place. Anti-lock brakes, computerized stability and traction control, all-wheel drive, low-tire-pressure detectors, reverse sensing systems, better suspension and handling, and blue-tint headlights all contribute to this end. In addition, states are enacting graduated licensing laws to limit new drivers until they gain experience. Finally the installation and analysis of \"black boxes\" that record data in the last seconds before a crash will allow engineers to better understand crashes and the causes of injuries."]}

In Kenya as two trucks approached the embassy, Khalid Mohammad Salim, now in U.S. custody, jumped from the lead white pick-up, driven by Haroun Fazil, and tossed a grenade at the guards before the bomb exploded. In Tanzania, at lease 6 men used two vehicles. The bomb was mounted on a 1987 Nissan Atlas refrigerator truck, and detonated by \"Ahmad the German\". As the Suzuki Samurai fled, a rider photographed the embassy ruins. In Tanzania, in June 1998, Fadhil rented a villa in Dar es Salaam. The truck was modified to carry the bomb's locally acquired batteries and oxygen/acetylene tanks. Some Middle East bomb components came by sea via Comoros Islands. In Kenya, from May to August suspect Haroun Fazil and Al-Qaeda associate Mohammed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali, rented a house outside Nairobi. Khalid Mohammad Salim and two other suspects conducted surveillance as phony fishmongers. Some bomb components came by road from Tanzania. Some bombers came through Somalia and Rwanda. On August 5, a Tanzania suspect called a Kenya suspect. On August 6, Odeh in Kenya and a Tanzania suspect fled to Pakistan. Others charged are Rashid Saleh Hemed; Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed; Khalfan Khamis Mohamed; Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani; Fahid Mohammed Ally Msalam; Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan; Mamdouh Mahmud Salim; Mohammad Sadik Howaida.", "Bombings of US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998 killed 224 and injured 5,000 in Kenya and killed 11 and injured 70 in Tanzania. The near simultaneity of the attacks indicated careful planning and close coordination by the perpetrators. Planning for the attack took three months and was carried out by an Egyptian Islamic Jihad group linked to Osama bin Laden. Some of the bombers entered Kenya through Somali and Rwanda. Explosives originated in the Middle East and were brought by sea to the Comoros Islands then to Tanzania. Those to be used in Kenya then went by road to Nairobi. Part of the bomb used at the embassy in Dar Es Salaam was assembled at Tomy Spaares Manufactures Ltd, a metal-working shop. A refrigerator truck transported the bomb that was detonated at the embassy. The bomb that destroyed the embassy in Nairobi was built at a house rented on the outskirts of that city by a man identified as Haroun Fazil. Fazil is alleged to have driven a white pickup truck to the embassy on the day of the bombing to lead the vehicle carrying the bomb. He and his associates are believed members of al-Qaeda. In all, 17 men have been indicted in New York on charges related to the bombings. Five of them who are still at large are accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden.", "Federal prosecutors in their investigation of the twin bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7, 1998 in which 233 were killed, including two suicide bombers, have charged at least 14 men. All the indicted are members of Islamic extremist groups and are believed to have conspired with Saudi terrorist, Osama bin Laden. They include at least several Egyptians, a Palestinian or Jordanian, several Kenyans and Tanzanians, and one US registered citizen. Four are in custody in New York, two await extradition from Germany and Britain, and the remainder are still at large. After approximately three months of planning, the bombings were clearly well coordinated and precisely timed to coincide. Bombers destined for Kenya were dispatched through Somalia and Rwanda. A Comorian Islander, Haroun Fazil, rented a house from May to August eight miles north of Nairobi where he was joined by at least four other conspirators. Evidence indicates the bomb that destroyed the embassy there was built in the rented house. Its components were transported from Tanzania. Two arrested suspects were seen hurling grenades at the Embassy guards just before the bomb explosions. In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, an Egyptian suspect rented a villa that became the \"bomb factory\". A rented Nissan refrigerator truck from a local prominent businessman's metal shop was equipped to carry the bomb. Oxygen and acetylene tanks and large batteries were installed to enhance the force of the explosion. A white Suzuki pickup truck was used by the suspects to flee.", "On August 7, 1998, coordinated bombings blasted the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. More than 250 people were killed and over 5,000 injured, most of them Kenyans and Tanzanians. Twelve Americans were killed. Shortly, thereafter, US federal law enforcement officials tentatively linked Osama bin Laden to the two bombings. Cairo-based, Islamic Jihad, financed by bin Laden was also suspected. Some suspects were arrested within the two first weeks after the blasts, Khalid Mohammed accused of hurling a grenade at security guards among them. Confessions by the early arrested suspects confirmed suspicions of the link with bin Laden. Two suspects, Khalid Salim and Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, were flown to the US for trial. Local police arrested many other suspects. Police were soon to determine the materials and methods involved in the bombing plot. The bomb ingredients originated in the Middle East, were transferred by sea via the Comoro Islands to Tanzania. The bomb was assembled at the home of Haroun Fazil, of Comoro. The explosive device was then attached to a vehicle in a metal workshop owned by prominent Dar Es Salaam businessman, Tony Lyimo. The bomb, packed with batteries and oxygen tanks to make it more explosive, was carried into the compound by refrigerator truck. Arrested suspect, Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, gave details of both bombing. In Kenya, the bomb was carried in a white Suzuki Sumurai. He had been warning US officials for months before the attack, saying that three vehicles would be used in an attack."]}

The International Art Loss Registry lists over 40,000 items in its memory bank ranging from snuff bottles to Van Goghs, each worth at least 1,000 pounds. Stealing art works has become the second biggest international criminal activity after narcotics. Recent major art thefts include: 3/18/90. Two robbers dressed as police officers steal 11 paintings and an ancient Chinese beaker from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. The stolen paintings included works by Rembrandt, Degas and Vermeer. Their worth: Hundreds of millions of dollars. 12/25/89.

Three armed robbers take 21 Renaissance paintings worth more than $5 million from a gallery in Zurich, Switzerland.", "Law enforcement agents account for most recoveries of stolen artwork. They often make recoveries in undercover operations or by acting on tips. Norwegian police in a sting operation recovered Munch's famous \"The Scream\". A Belgian policeman posing as an art dealer recovered a Picasso stolen in Sweden. An informant set up the purchase of a Goya from a retired Argentine police commissioner who was arrested by the FBI. Police in Britain acting on a phone tip recovered stolen art, including works by Dali and Matisse. Police recovered paintings stolen from the Louvre, and Soviet custom authorities recovered artwork stolen from the Hermitage. Tips have led to the recovery of a Munch lithograph, a Rodin bronze, a Dali, Warhol works, and ancient Mayan treasures. Law enforcement agents are not the only ones responsible for the recovery of stolen artworks. A reward led to the recovery of a stolen sculpture in California. Works brought to Sotheby's and Cristie's auction houses for evaluation or sale have turned out to be stolen; a Rembrandt drawing was recovered this way. French masterpieces seized by the Nazis during World War II were found in a cupboard of a Berlin museum. Van Gogh paintings stolen in Amsterdam were recovered from the getaway car abandoned by the thieves. When law enforcement agents recover stolen art, they often arrest suspects. Dutch thieves who stole three Van Goghs and demanded a ransom for their return were sent to jail. Arrests do not always result when others are responsible for recoveries.", "Documentation is essential to recovering a stolen work of art. When photographs and documentation are available, identification of stolen artwork can be confirmed. In Great Britain, the International Art Loss Registry founded by the leading auction houses (Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips) has a computerized data bases easily accessed by law enforcement authorities and insurance companies. In France, art dealers are obliged by law to register all purchases except those bought at public auction. Each year the International Foundation for Art Research adds over 2,000 stolen art works to its files. Stealing art works is the second biggest international criminal activity after narcotics. Experts estimate that only 5% to 10% of stolen art ever gets returned to the owners. Good police work often leads to recovery of stolen works and to the arrest and prosecution of those who steal works of art. Police go undercover, they set-up phony \"buys\", they develop informers and follow-up on tips. Some stolen art is recovered through rewards offered. In some cases, accomplices have informed on fellow thieves or gang members to recover artwork and to lessen charges against them. Paintings have been recovered when abandoned after being stolen and some have been recovered when poorly concealed by the thieves.", "Stolen art has been recovered when offered to police sting operations or to legitimate buyers or dealers, who detect that the offered art is stolen through catalogs of stolen items circulated among dealers, auction houses, museums and police or by their consulting the International Art Loss Register, to which any one, not just major art holders, can report thefts. In France dealers must register all purchased art, except what is bought at auction. Similar art registry laws are expected in Britain. Good photographic and other documentation uniquely describing the item and circumstances of its theft, are essential for the success of such registries in identifying possible stolen items. Recovery has come after a tip from a witness, accomplice or a citizen just reporting, anonymously or not, something suspicious, or in response to publicity by authorities, the owners or other interested parties, with or without a reward. Thieves or illicit buyers may intentionally or inadvertently let others know they have the items, which creates an information trail followed by authorities. Ransom attempts expose thieves to capture. Stolen art has just been abandoned in public places, come across by citizens, or in the course of routine police activities, like traffic stops. Police have conducted broad searches of areas where stolen items might possibly be. Arrests were made in about 22 of the roughly 50 art theft incidents reported in the data, indicating, if anything, more about general press interest in arrests, per se, than in all but the highest profile art thefts.", "Recovery of stolen artworks is often a result of long-term sleuthing and tips as the goods change hands through sale and resale. Upon recovery charges of receiving stolen goods may be filed while the thief remains unknown. For example, a million dollar theft of Nepalese and Tibetan art objects in New York in 1978 was solved eleven years later and items were recovered in the South Los Angeles home of an original suspect who was then charged not with theft but \"on suspicion of receiving and transporting stolen property\". A Rubens painting stolen from a Spanish museum in 1985 was recovered in Florida in 1991 by an undercover US customs agent when four Miami residents tried to sell the painting to him. Alert and honest auction house or art shop employees may recognize a stolen object brought to them in all innocence for sale or evaluation resulting in recovery but no charges as in the case of two portraits stolen in London in 1990, bought at a London market for 145 pounds in 1993 and brought to Sotheby's for evaluation. (They were worth 65,000 pounds.) On the other hand police sometimes receive tips that allow them to move quickly against art thieves. In May 1989 police in Rio de Janeiro received a phone tip, staked out an apartment and were able to recover millions of dollars of artwork stolen earlier in the month, to arrest five men and to identify three other suspects.", "Only 5% to 10% of stolen art works are returned to their owners. One tool in recovering art is the International Foundation of Art Research in New York, which maintains a registry of stolen art. The foundation issues special magazines to alert collectors, dealers, museums, insurance companies and law enforcement of new thefts. It also will be linked to auction house catalogues. The International Art Loss Register is a computerized database of thefts, where police can search to identify seized items. Also, French dealers are required to register all purchases. In addition to data bases and publicity, stolen art is recovered when someone seeks a appraisal or offers it for sale to dealers or auction houses, responds to a reward offer, attempts to move it through customs, or requests a ransom for the art. Police raids may uncover treasure troves. Most commonly informants provide the key information, but some art is abandoned and some thieves turn themselves or the stolen goods in. The arrest and prosecution of the culprits is even more rare than the recovery. Again informants--sometimes one of the perpetrators--play a key role in permitting an arrest. Police raids also can immediately result in arrests, either of the thieves or the fences. Three thieves in Holland were arrested after demanding a ransom. A former employee of Buckingham Palace was arrested trying to sell a painting. Two well-know art figures were held after selling stolen gouaches. Three Swedes were arrested in a Belgian police sting operation.", "Stolen art is often recovered during attempts to sell it. A 17th century oil painting, stolen from Buckingham Palace, was found when offered to an auction house. A former employee was charged. Two portraits, brought to Sotheby's for evaluation by a man who bought them at a market, were recovered using the Art Loss Register database. No suspects were arrested. Works are recovered in undercover stings, such as a Picasso, recovered in Brussels, and a Rubens, recovered in Miami. Suspects were arrested in both cases. El Greco and Goya pieces were recovered in Miami, and a retired Argentine police commissioner and his wife were arrested. Police work resulted in the recovery of Italian Renaissance masterpieces, Munch's Madonna, and a Monet and other works taken from Paris. Arrests were made in all cases. Tips helped police recover 81 Andy Warhol lithographs, and millions of dollars of art, including works by Dali and Matisse. Three Munch's were recovered with assistance from one of the thieves. Arrests were made in all cases. In the strange category, 20 Van Gogh's were found in an abandoned getaway car, eight Matisse's were recovered in a traffic stop, and a tiny Renoir was found in a museum washroom ventilation duct. Five masterpieces, including a Renoir, were recovered when the thief confessed and was arrested. One of three stolen Van Gogh's was found in a car trunk, along with a ransom demand for the other two, which were later recovered. Two men were convicted of the theft.", "Stolen artwork has been recovered when offered to undercover agents (of police, FBI, customs) posing as dealers or buyers. It has been recognized and recovered when brought to auction houses or dealers for sale or evaluation. Customs has seized stolen artwork being taken abroad. Police have recovered stolen art after thieves' arrests, through dragnets and raids, and during a routine traffic stop. Tipsters have reported locations or dispositions of stolen art, a dealer's activity, and a suspicious driver. Stolen artwork has been found in a museum washroom's ventilation duct and abandoned near a railway station. Masterpieces seized by Nazis in WWII were reported by a museum where they had been stored. Searches for one item sometimes turn up others. Ransoms asked by thieves have led to recovery. Rewards have prompted reports of stolen artwork's location. The London-based International Art Loss Register (ALR), a computerized database containing descriptions and photographs of stolen artwork and linked with auction house catalogue information, has been highly successful. Insurance companies, dealers, and owners register thefts and conduct searches. The ALR serves as liaison between police forces. The Manhattan-based International Foundation for Art Research issues art-theft alerts to collectors, dealers, museums, insurance companies and law enforcement, and offers rewards. The FBI has assigned agents to investigate art thefts exclusively. Documentation and photographs of artwork are essential for recovery. French law requires dealers to register purchases. Centralized inventory records for museums aid in theft awareness. Only 5-10% of stolen artworks are recovered. Suspects are not always arrested.", "Theft of precious artwork by global criminals has become common, second only to narcotics theft. Much artwork is recovered by police in cooperation with agencies like the International Foundation for Art Research which has descriptions of many masterpieces and by the International Art Loss Register, a computerized database of stolen art. The publicity generated by the foundations makes it harder to dispose of stolen art. Auction houses often recognize artworks brought to them as stolen. The art is frequently recovered but the thieves not found. Some examples follow. A Rubens painting stolen from a Spanish Museum was recovered in Florida and four Miami residents were arrested in connection with the theft. Two armed thieves stole 20 Van Gogh paintings in Amsterdam, but abandoned their haul in a railway station. No arrests were made. Two portraits from London were recovered using the Loss Register when the paintings were brought to Southby's Auction House. Italian police recovered two 17th century paintings valued at nine million dollars. Norwegian police arrested three people for theft of Munch's painting, The Scream. A Belgian policeman posing as an art dealer arrested three Swedes trying to sell a stolen Picasso painting. Thieves who stole a Raphael self-portrait from a Hungarian museum were caught in a dragnet before transporting the painting to Greece. A man suspected of stealing a million-dollar collection of Nepalese and Tibetan art objects in New York was arrested. A dozen masterpieces were taken from Boston's Gardner Museum, the biggest art theft in US history."]}

How are the problems being addressed?", "summaries": ["There is not enough low-cost housing in the United States. In 1995 there were 4.4 million more low-income earners than there were low-cost housing units and the pool of affordable housing was shrinking. Landlords were dropping out of rent subsidy programs to raise the rent or convert the real estate to condominiums. The number of homeless was rising. In addition, rents were going up faster than incomes. In 1997 at least 4.5 million families were paying more than 50% of their income on housing, up 12% since 1991. To address this crisis, various programs were used to create more low-cost housing. Tax credits were created to encourage builders to build more units and build in low-income areas. Grants were made to non-profit organizations to build or rehabilitate apartments for the elderly and disabled. One jurisdiction was granting builders greater density construction for reserving a percentage of units to rent below market value. Local governments can seize abandoned houses to convert to affordable homes. More money was allocated to subsidize landlords who rent below market value. Real estate investment trusts were being formed that specialized in affordable housing. More money must also be made available to the poor. The number of rent vouchers given to low-income city dwellers was increased. Using these vouchers to buy a home became possible in 2000. Special low-interest loans were to be made available to low-income and minority individuals. The dollar limit of federally insured mortgages was raised. Raising the minimum wage also was proposed.", "Despite a strong economy and real estate boom in America, the number of people living below poverty level has increased. The amount of affordable housing for low and moderate-income residents has dramatically decreased during the same period. Hardest hit are single mothers, elderly, immigrants and working poor. The working poor pay more than half their income for housing. Part of the problem is wage increases have failed to keep up with steep increases in rental rates. To make matters worse, many owners of rental units now rent to higher income tenants or sell their properties as condos. Furthermore, in the late 1990s, Congress failed to increase the amount of low cost housing or the number of housing vouchers for government rent subsidies. Both Republicans and Democrats agreed there was a significant need for housing for low and moderate-income families, but disagreed on the resolution to the problem. Republican favored giving more subsidized rental units for the working poor, while Democrats favored subsidizing the poorest in the nation. Republican wanted public housing to be available to all income groups, (mixed use). The two parties compromised on a bill that provides increased funding for housing vouchers and a $822 million program that would help the elderly and disabled. HUD will increase payments and provide other incentives to landlords who participate in subsidized housing programs. In 2000, President Clinton proposed great expansion of the voucher program. In addition to federal programs, many state and local jurisdictions have creative programs to provide low-income housing.", "Low-income Americans face problems in finding housing because their numbers have increased over the last two decades while the pool of affordable housing has shrunk. Landlords have dropped out of subsidy programs or properties have been closed because of age or razed. Wages haven't kept up with housing cost rises driven by a strong economy. Jobs have increased in suburbs with little affordable housing and no transportation. Congress refused any new assistance vouchers between 1995-1998. Public housing turnover is low and waiting lists are long. Also, public housing concentrates extremely poor people, sapping commercial vitality and fostering racial and economic segregation. Minority mortgage applicants face discrimination. The elderly poor are needlessly warehoused in sterile nursing homes for lack of affordable alternatives. Efforts to address these problems include updating the 1937 public housing law. In 1977 banks were required to loan money to low-income and minority residents where they did business. Real or proposed measures include block grants to states for housing assistance, greater availability of rent subsidies and federally insured mortgages, use of rent vouchers to help buy a home, and incentives or requirements to keep landlords in subsidy programs and encourage the creation of subsidized housing units. To provide a better economic mix, the working poor have been lured to housing projects through relaxed income limits, set-aside units, and bump-ups on waiting lists. Real Estate Investment Trusts specializing in affordable housing were established. It was proposed that FHA revenues be reserved for use in federal housing initiatives.", "No new U.S. federal housing assistance vouchers were created after 1994. In 1995, the number of people making $12,000 or less exceeded the number of low-rent units by 4.4 million. There were two low-income renters for every low-cost unit -- in the West, closer to three. Eight out of 10 people below the federal poverty line, many on minimum wage, pay more than 30 percent of their income for rent. Three-fifths of all poor renters spent more than halve their income on rent. In 1997 5.4 million were paying more than 50% of income for housing. In 1998, 90,000 new rent vouchers were created and $283 million rent subsidy for 50,000 welfare job seekers. There were large concentrations of extremely poor people in dysfunctional public housing projects. To bring in families earning more, preferences were suspended for the homeless, people spending more than 50% of income on housing, domestic violence victims, and people displaced by government action, which took units away from the poorest families. In 1998, with rising real estate prices, local governments increased construction and sale of low and moderate-income housing, and lucrative real estate investment trusts arose to privately fund low-income housing projects. The $25 billion FY1999 housing budget provided $1.8 billion in new vouchers, and $822 million for construction and rehabilitation of apartment units and rent subsidies for low-income elderly or the disabled. In 2000, federal rent subsidies increased from 40% to 50%, adding 1.4 million units nationwide. Vouchers could be used to pay home mortgages."]}
{"id": "D0610A", "query": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of home schooling? Is the trend growing or declining?", "summaries": ["By the late 1990's, home schooling proved to be increasingly popular in the United States. Religious conservatives see home schooling as providing numerous advantages, including the means to provide family-based religious and moral education not available in public schools and as a way to avoid the secularization of schools and teaching of subjects as evolution. Families who considered themselves part of the counterculture see home schooling as providing advantages such as encouraging independent expressions and exposure a broad range of experience. More conventional families, concerned that their children were not getting enough individual attention in school, view home schooling as providing a better learning environment and a more complete education. Advocates claim that home schoolers significantly outperform their public-school peers. They also claim that home schooling is a way to avoid school-related problems such as crime, drugs, and violence. Opponents of home schooling cite several disadvantages. One is that it deprives home schoolers from exposure to the outside world and to peers needed for them to grow into well-rounded adults. Another is that it deprives home schoolers of the advantages public schools have in science and sports. It also requires considerable time, money, and effort. The number of home schoolers tripled to 1.7 million during the 1990's, and was projected to continue growing at a rate of at least 15% a year. One reason is that home schooling, which had become legal in all 50 states, gained widespread political support. Politicians proposed the use of school vouchers for home schooling.", "The trend towards home schooling has been growing with the number of home-schooled children in the United States increasing from a couple of hundred in 1983 to 1.3-1.7 million in 2000 at the rate of 7 percent per year. Advocates of home schooling tout its advantages as a safe haven from the drugs, violence, failing academic achievement, peer pressure and overcrowded classrooms of public schools and the expense of private schools. Home schooling allows the parent to provide \"customized education\" focusing on the individual's needs rather than contending with the diverse needs and abilities of a large class. The teacher can develop the whole child inculcating moral, religious, ethnic and cultural values while fostering self-esteem. Questioning and self-expression are encouraged. Some observers contend that home-schooled children mature faster and on average achieve better academic results than public school students. Critics of home schooling maintain that it reduces support for public schools where most children attend and prevents the developing child from socializing and facing the real world. Some parents are not competent to teach all courses, although cooperation with associates and use of on-line curriculum resources can help. Home schoolers admit that parents make financial sacrifice and work long hours. Some parents follow a free form allowing children to pursue their particular interests without regard to a comprehensive curriculum. It is clear that most home-schooled children fall behind in sports and science and tend to have few friends their own age, but many excel academically and socially.", "Home schooling is a fast-growing trend. The number of home schooled children has tripled in the 1990s to up to 1.7 million. Although this represents less than 2% of all school-age children in the country, the trend is moving into the educational mainstream. Reasons for home schooling vary. So-called \"unschoolers\" prefer a free-form educational philosophy. Parents choose to home school for religious reasons. Objecting to the secularization of schools, they wish to shield their children from the dangers and temptations of popular culture and teach them moral and religious values. Some parents home school to preserve the family's religious and cultural identities. Recently, more parents home school because of dissatisfaction with the quality of public schools and the expense of private schools. Advantages of home schooling include safety and security from school violence such as the Columbine incident; great class size; the ability to customize one's education; continuity for children whose families move often; the children's becoming more independent and less \"peer dependant\"; and the increasing availability of resources, support groups and online classes. On average, home schooled children outperform their counterparts on standardized tests and in academic competitions. Detractors of home schooling argue that the isolated environment hinders socialization; it requires a tremendous sacrifice of parents' time and finances; parents might lack the ability to provide the rigor and depth needed in all subjects; the children might have problems transitioning into college and the adult world; and public schools have more resources in areas like science and sports.", "The number of Americans teaching their own children at home has more than tripled since the beginning of the decade and is growing by at least 15% per year. Claims are that home-schooled students out-perform their public school peers, but they are not supported by reliable data. Home-schooling can surpass public schools in providing family-based religious and moral education, stability during frequent moves, a safer environment, individual attention, and ethnic pride. Home-schooled students are exposed to more of an age range than public school students. Home-schoolers can be innovative in seeking a variety of experiences for their students. Some programs depend largely on the whims of the student(s). Students who are absorbed in a topic are not subject to time constraints. Home-schooling, especially with computers, can be a boon to those who are physically challenged or in remote areas. The popularity of home-schooling has caused some public schools to seek ways of changing and improving. On the other hand, home-schooled students may have fewer opportunities to associate with others of the same age or of differing ethnic/racial/income groups, or work as part of a team. Parents' extremist views or educational level may affect the quality of their home-schooling. Home-schooling may be financially straining or unfeasible. Many home-schooling programs that depend on computers and connectivity are criticized as being techno-elite. Some suspect home-schoolees of goofing off. Home-schoolees may find the transition to college and/or the workplace challenging. Home-schooling causes a financial disadvantage to those school systems dependent on funding per attendance."]}

A 1995 a referendum on Quebec independence was defeated, but by a much smaller margin than previously. The Quebec Premier resigned and the new leader, Lucien Bouchard, vowed to keep the independence movement alive. In a 1998 provincial election Bouchard won more seats (but slightly less of the popular vote) and did not get enough votes to permit another referendum immediately. Polls also show support for separation had declined, although there was feeling that just the threat of separation is enough to bring about change. However, even without a referendum Bouchard's re-election could increase tensions and uncertainty in Canada. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court decided against the constitutionality of unilateral secession. However, it did say that if a majority of Quebeckers voted in favor of secession, federal officials would be obliged to negotiate. Bouchard is now in a position to work any attempt to provide changes to his advantage. One is for increased power in managing the health care system. If his proposals are rebuffed he can open the way to another referendum, which he said he would do if \"winning conditions exist\". So Bouchard may or may not bring about another referendum, which he may or may not do if there are winning conditions, although he won't specify what they are. That's why there is still uncertainty in Quebec!", "The movement for separation of Quebec from Canada began in the 1960's leading to the first referendum in the province in May 1980 when 40% voted for independence. In another referendum in 1995 the \"yes\" vote was a very strong loser with over 49% of the vote. The Quebec Premier Parizeau resigned after defeat in the referendum and Lucien Bouchard stepped forward to assume the Premiership and leadership of the Party Quebecois (Separatist). Bouchard pledged to hold another referendum if his party won the next election in 1998. Canadian Prime Minister Chretien took a firm stand asserting that Quebec could not unilaterally secede without amendment of the Canadian Constitution. The issue was presented to the Supreme Court which ruled in August 1998 that Quebec could not separate unilaterally and if a referendum favored separation details would have to be negotiated with Canada. As the November election approached polls indicated that Bouchard had a wide lead over the Liberal (Federalist) candidate. The results were much closer with the Separatists continuing control of the Quebec legislature, but losing a single seat and gaining only 42.7% of the vote compared to the Liberal (Federalist) 43.7%. The Separatist movement appeared in shatters and polls showed only 41% favoring independence. Prime Minister Chretien's \"tough love\" campaign for a clear definition of what would be required for independence antagonized Quebeckers. In March 2000 the Canadian House of Commons began considering Chretien's Clanty Bill with 411 amendments offered by a revived separatist movement.", "Language and cultural differences divide Quebec, Canada's only province with a French-speaking majority, from the rest of the country. French-speaking nationalists have long supported either independence or increased autonomy. Quebeckers voted on two independence referendums, unsuccessfully in 1980 and nearly victoriously in 1995. In 1996, Lucien Bouchard became Quebec's premier and leader of the separatist Parti Quebecois, putting him in a position to hold a third referendum. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien declared that unilateral secession was illegal and could only be accomplished through a constitutional amendment. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled against unilateral secession, but stipulated that federal officials would be obligated to negotiate if a clear majority of Quebeckers voted for secession in a fair referendum. In the late 1990s, most Canadians believed that Quebec would face partition if it were to secede. Minorities such as Intuit and Cree natives, Acadians, and some English-speaking residents in western Quebec and Montreal were against secession. Polls indicated most Quebeckers didn't want another referendum. Bouchard and his Parti Quebecois retained control in 1998 provincial elections. However, the party fell short of the 46% of seats in the provincial assembly needed to hold a third referendum. In 1999, Chrétien proposed legislation making secession attempts difficult for Quebec. It required a \"clear majority\" on a \"clear question\" and that Quebec would have to negotiate with the federal and provincial governments its share of the $400 billion national debt, its borders, and its plans to guarantee the rights of Indians and linguistic minorities.", "The political movement for the province of Quebec to attain independence from Canada began in the 1960s. It stemmed from the feeling among Quebeckers that their culture is different from the rest of Canada -- more than 80 percent of the 7 million Quebeckers speak French. They would prefer to manage their own affairs and have their own national symbols. In the first referendum on independence, in May 1980, separatist gained 40 percent of votes in Quebec. Another referendum was held in October 1995, and this time the vote in favor was just over 49 percent. Following the referendum, Jacques Parizeau, leader of Parti Quebecois and Quebec premier, resigned and was replaced by Lucien Bouchard, a separatist. Quebec at the time was experiencing serious financial problems. Opinion indicated that Quebeckers wanted Bouchard to focus on the economy rather than independence. Canada's Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, ruled out any declaration of independence even if Quebec voted for secession in another referendum. The Supreme Court, hearing the case of Quebec separation, ruled that, under the Canadian Constitution and international law, Quebec could not separate unilaterally from Canada and that if separatists won a referendum on independence, the government would be obliged to negotiate with Quebec. Bouchard's ruling party won re-election in the 1998 election. He promised another referendum on independence. However, support for separation was low. Quebeckers wanted the government to deal instead with economic conditions. Meanwhile, the federal government introduced a bill aimed at making separation attempts more difficult."]}
{"id": "D0635H", "query": "How has the administration of Governor George W. Bush implemented capital punishment and how are those policies viewed outside of Texas?", "summaries": ["Texas Governor George W. Bush defended the death penalty as a deterrent to crime and presided over a record 143 executions. In five years he halted only one, because of faulty evidence, and granted one 30-day reprieve. He based decisions on doubt about guilt and court opportunity for reviewing legal issues. He believed no innocent people were executed and that he had no right to overturn jury verdicts. He could recommend clemency only if the 18-member Board of Pardons and Paroles, all of whom he appointed, recommended it. Board members held no meetings and voted by fax or telephone. Bush opposed public clemency meetings as opportunities for emotionalizing the process. Bush speeded the appeals process, opposed barring execution of the mentally retarded, vetoed creation of impartial public defender systems, and said he favored DNA testing but did not push to require it. Texas' clemency process has been criticized widely as violating minimum safeguards for human rights. The parole board has been described as hostile, secretive, unconstitutional, unfair to indigent defendants, and interested only in preserving the system and the illusion of review. Proceedings are undocumented so there is no way to determine whether voting is arbitrary or meets due process requirements. Few letters are forwarded to board members. The Pope and others unsuccessfully asked Bush to stay executions for a Canadian citizen, a born-again woman, and the mentally ill. Bush has been criticized for callousness and being disengaged. The public still supports the death penalty but support is shrinking dramatically.", "Since George W. Bush became governor of Texas in 1995, the state has executed 143 people making it the leading state in the nation for putting inmates to death. A majority of Texans support the death penalty and do not believe an innocent person has been executed in Texas during Bush's administration. The 18-member Texas Board of Pardons and Parole recommends to the governor whether to commute sentences to life in prison or grant temporary reprieves. It casts its votes on clemency secretly, usually by fax or telephone, and has granted clemency only once in 17 years. The governor can only issue a one-time, 30-day reprieve or act on a recommendation from the parole board to grant a stay, commute a sentence, or issue a pardon. The Board has been criticized outside Texas for not thoroughly reviewing cases, for not holding meetings, and for not conducting business in public. This means there is no way to determine whether the Texas process meets due process requirements that the Supreme Court has said must exist. It prevents any genuine opportunity for death row inmates to seek and obtain reduction of their sentences. There is also criticism of the State's treatment of the mentally ill, sentencing them to death despite evidence of mental illness. A recent report on an investigation of the death cases under Bush's tenure showed that some lawyers representing defendants were sanctioned or later disbarred, psychiatrists had not examined many of the defendants, and that one judge had been reprimanded.", "During five and a half years of George W. Bush's tenure as governor, Texas executed 143 prisoners on death row, far more than any other state during modern times. Women, juveniles, and mentally deficient were among those executed. Bush has repeatedly said that he reviews each case for any doubt of the condemned's guilt. In only one case has Bush granted a 30-day reprieve and told the parole board to review the case so DNA tests could be pursued. By law a Texas governor cannot halt an execution unless the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles first recommends a reprieve, commutation to a life sentence or a pardon. He can veto a board vote on those recommendations. He cannot overrule a board vote to proceed with an execution. The Board was appointed by Governor Bush and is believed to share his views on capital punishment. Governor Bush vetoed a bill to establish a state public defender system. Lacking such a system many indigent defendants were poorly defended according to a study published in the Chicago Tribune. Bush responded that the defendants had full access to a fair trial. Amnesty International claims Texas' secretive clemency process for condemned criminals violates minimum safeguards for human rights. The Canadian Foreign Minister contended that sentencing a Canadian to death row violated an international treaty. The death sentence of Karla Faye Tucker brought pleas for clemency from Pope John Paul II and from Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson because of Tucker's death row conversion to Christianity.", "As Texas Governor from 1995 to 2000, capital punishment defender George W. Bush oversaw a record 146 executions. He granted one 30-day reprieve and once commutation. A Texas governor can only accept the recommendation of the 18-member Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles or grant a one-time 30-day reprieve. Bush appointed all his board's members. Bush read board recommendations and a 3-4 page memos by staff lawyers and discussed appeals for usually 15 - 45 minutes, sometimes up to 2 hours. He'd ask, \"OK, did he do it? Did he get a fair trial\"? He publicly mocked one condemned woman's pleas to be spared. He never witnessed an execution. One man was put on life support and flown from hospital to the death chamber for execution on schedule. Bush vetoed unanimous legislation creating a public defender system for indigent defendants. Local judges pick indigents' defense lawyers using a patronage system. Bush opposed legislation to not execute the mentally ill. Bush favored, but did not champion DNA testing. Critics said Texas is the most unfair of 38 death penalty states, with inadequate legal aid and appeals. The Pardons Board is criticized for conducting decisions in secrecy by fax or telephone from members scattered about the state. Its undocumented procedures appear arbitrary. A U.S. District Court upheld the constitutionality of Texas's clemency system, but sharply criticized it. Amnesty International said Texas gave only \"the illusion of meaningful clemency review.\" The Christian Coalition criticized Bush for not saving a convicted but born-again murderer."]}
{"id": "D435F", "query": "By how much is world population projected to grow or decline in the next century, and what are the principal factors influencing growth or decline worldwide and in specific countries?", "summaries": ["In the early 1970s, a successful but controversial population control program was enacted in China. The goal is one child per family, and financial penalties are used to achieve it. The program strongly promotes contraception; abortion is widely available. The policy has had a dramatic effect, with the fertility rate falling to around 1.9 from 2.25 by 1994. Egypt's population control program has seen the use of contraceptives rise from 28 percent to 50 percent in just over a decade. It has cut the annual growth in population from 2.8 percent in 1980 to 2.2 percent in 1994. Since 1956, a policy of family planning has been in place in Tunisia. It offers free prescriptions for the pill and free confidential advice on contraception. The birth rate has declined from 45 to 24.4 per 1,000. In Brazil, the female fertility rate began a fall from 5.8 in 1970 to 2.3 percent in 1994. The main reason was increased access to, and demand for, contraception. By 1986, 66 percent of women of child-bearing age were using contraception. In 1988, the Iranian government, alarmed by an annual population growth rate of 3.9 percent, began promoting the use of all contraceptive methods. Only abortion was not allowed. By 1994 the population growth rate had declined to 1.8 percent. In 1994, the Philippines instituted an aggressive population program that promoted the use of contraceptives. The program succeeded in lowering the growth rate from 2.4 percent to 2.1 percent in the first half of 1994.", "The world's population was estimated to grow from 5.7 billion in 1994 to 10 billion by 2050. Depending on assumptions about birth rates, this figure could range from 7.8 to 12.5 billion. Birth rates vary considerably by region. Fertility rate -- the average number of children per women -- is 4 in India, 2.4 in China, but more than 6 in sub-Saharan Africa. Africa's growth rate is 2.9 percent, the world's highest; Asia and Latin America have rates less than 2 percent; Western Europe's rate is 1.7 percent. Factors influencing fertility rates include economic conditions, access to contraception, educational and economic opportunities for women, and government birth control policies and programs. After the Iranian revolution, clerics and the government encouraged large families. The subsequent high population growth rate became viewed as a threat to economic development, and a family planning program was implemented. To raise living standards and restrain pressure on scarce resources, China instituted a one child per couple policy. To permit its population to enjoy the benefits of its economic growth, the Phillipine government pushed a contraception program to slow its population growth. To combat overcrowding and poverty, Egypt used a family planning program. The emancipation of women plus the availability of birth control devices reduced the birth rate in Tunisia. Urbanization plus the increased use of contraception contributed to the decline of Brazil's fertility rate. After the fall of the Berlin wall, East Germany's fertility rate decline was attributed to a widespread sense of uncertainty.", "The United Nations has forecasted that the world's population will likely double to more than ten billion people by the year 2050. This projection is less than that predicted twenty years earlier when estimates went as high as 12.5 billion. Thus, the rate of growth, world-wide, is slowing but still about a billion people will be added each year by mid-21st century. Population growth rates have been slowed in virtually all parts of the world except for sub-Saharan Africa countries and even a few countries there such as Zimbabwe and Botswana have seen a decline. Moslem countries such as Indonesia, Iran, Egypt and especially, Tunisia have slowed birth rates. Catholic countries with large populations and high birth rates such as Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines are beginning to see slowing in birth rates. In many traditional Catholic countries of Europe, the birth rate has fallen to or near the replacement rate so to these countries immigration is a factor in maintaining a level population. China, the most populous country, has instituted programs to limit births but will still see large gains in population. Japan, France and Finland are heading toward zero population growth. Factors influencing growth rate are that women have more educational opportunity, access to family planning and methods of contraception. Large families are no longer seen as advantageous in many parts of the world. Lower death rates in most parts of the world also influence population levels.", "UN projections estimate that the world's population, at 5.5 billion in 1993, will reach 11 billion by 2050 although the figure could be anywhere from 5 billion to 20 billion. Different parts of the world differ widely in their fertility rates. In 1993 sub-Saharan Africa had a fertility rate of more than 6, India 4, China 2.4, U.K. 1.8, West Germany 1.4, and Italy/Spain 1.2. As a general rule highly developed industrialized countries have lower birth rates and underdeveloped rural countries have higher birth rates although governmental and cultural influences play a role. Strong governmental programs providing sex education and promoting contraception and equality for women in a Moslem country, Tunisia, brought the birth rate down from 45 per 1,000 to 24.4 per 1,000 between 1963 and 1994. In Moslem and Roman Catholic countries religious authorities may be in conflict with governmental attempts to control population growth, but sex education and contraception programs have been effective in Iran (average growth rate 1988-3.9%, 1994-1.8%) and Brazil (fertility rate 1970-5.8%, 1975- 4.3%, 1984-3.6%). Immigration is a factor in reducing population of underdeveloped countries and increasing population in developed countries that offer economic opportunity. Scotland, for example, reversed a long-standing yearly decline in population in 1991 with an influx of immigrants. Birth control in the west and Japan is creating aging societies and shortage of younger laborers while developing nations produce more people than they can accommodate, thus fueling immigration.", "The 1994 annual U.N. Population Fund report projects that by 2050 the world population will have grown from 1994's 5.7 billion to stabilize at 10 billion (if population growth rates continue to decline as expected), 7.8 billion (if rates decline even just a little faster than expected) or 12.5 billion (if today's rates stop falling). Some labor-strapped countries like France still give economic incentives for families to have more children. Some belief systems significantly influence global population rate increases, especially in traditional Catholic and Islamic countries, which favor large families and discourage women's reproductive rights. Conversely, in 1977 labor-strapped Singapore, births declined 12% during the astrologically inauspicious \"year of the snake\". Yet, the serious economic disadvantages to nations and individuals of over-population have driven Islamic Iran, Egypt, Albania, Tunisia (which abolished polygamy), and largely Catholic Spain, Italy, Mexico, Brazil and other Latin American countries to remove government subsidies encouraging large families, start family planning (particularly contraception); women's health and education; and women's emancipation and employment efforts, to reduce fertility rates, as have the U.K., Germany, India, China, Mauritius, the Philippines, Zimbabwe and Botswana. Elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa growth rates remain high, while AIDS cuts growth only 1%. China, with one abortion for every two live births, imposed severe penalties for urban families wanting more than one child and aggressively promoted sterilization (as did Brazil). Prosperity and education raise off-spring survival rates, which naturally lower fertility rates, such as when families migrate from poor rural areas to more prosperous cities.", "Assuming the birthrate continues its present fall, the population of the world is expected to be 10 billion before it stabilizes in 2050. If the birthrate falls by more, the projection is 7.8 billion in 2050 or if it stops falling the population could reach 12.5 billion. The decline in birthrates around the world can be attributed primarily to the education of women, culture, urbanization, and the availability of contraception. Japan and most European nations reached zero growth. Only Irish and Polish women have more than two children. By 1994, the birthrate plummeted in eastern Germany and the former Soviet Union because of insecurity and the end of Communist subsidies to families. The policy in China is to limit couples to one child through financial incentives and aggressively promoting contraception. Women being educated, working, and using contraception have slowed Tunisia's rate, while Singapore's dropped too sharply for the government. Population continues to grow in sub-Saharan Africa, where few use contraception and six children are born per woman. Women's subordinate position contributes to population growth in Egypt, Indonesia, and the Gulf states. The average Indian woman continues to have four children. A government program and contraception access is starting to slow Iran's rate. Although a Catholic country, Mexico is trying to limit growth and 48% of the women use contraception. The fertility rate in Brazil has dropped because of urbanization and contraception. The poor and Catholic Philippines continues with a high rate, which the government is just beginning to address..", "By the year 2050, the world population is expected to double from 5.7 bn to some 10.6 bn. Nearly 95 percent of the projected rise will come from developing countries. Population growth continues to be slow in developed, industrialized countries. However, contrary to previous theories of demographers, declines in the rate of population growth have occurred even in countries that have seen little economic growth. A major reason for the growth is that in developed countries the growth rate of the aging population is outdistancing the youth population. The major factors affecting lower growth rates around the world are: increased literacy rights granted to women, family planning programs, and higher employment. The growth rate in American is about 1 percent a year, 0.5 percent in Russia, and 0.3 percent in Western Europe. The emancipation of women, along with state-controlled family programs and the increasing use of contraceptives in Tunisia and Egypt, has cut the population growth rate in those countries nearly in half. The fertility rate in Iran has dropped significantly due to a government program for population control. A sharp slowdown has also occurred in Brazil and other Latin American countries. China has a strict birth control policy but it is not effective in the countryside. Sub-Saharan African states of Botswana, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, along with India, Ethiopia and Mexico, have the world's highest population growth largely due to a low literacy level. High population growth is expected to cause large-scale migration with a negative impact on world economy.", "By UN projections, the world population will reach over 10 billion in 2050 before it stabilizes. That is double the present 5.5 billion. However, depending on whether birthrates continue to fall, the 2050 population could end up somewhere between 7.8 and 12.5 billion. Economics, religion, and women's education are major factors that influence population growth or decline. Wherever governments have encouraged family planning, birth rates have dropped. Countries which have seen birth rates decline include Egypt, China, India, Tunisia, and Brazil. Iran's clerics, who initially encouraged large families, now encourage family planning, which has dropped their growth rate from 3.9% to 2.3%. Birth rates in Latin American countries have fallen dramatically, with growth rates under 2%. However, growth rates in Mexico and the Philippines remain high at 2.4% Africa's growth rate of 2.9% is the highest in the world. Sub-Saharan Africa has fertility rates over 6 per woman. The World Bank projects a doubling of the population to one billion in the next 30 years. Family planning is encouraged only in Zimbabwe and Botswana. In the coming years, industrialized countries can expect slow growth at a rate of 1% in North America,.5% in the former Soviet Union, and .3% in Europe. Eastern Germany's fertility rate has plummeted to .8, mainly due to the change in economics and the new-found freedom to travel. Singapore's \"two is enough\" policy was too successful, drastically shrinking its population. It now offers tax incentives to have a third child .", "United Nations population projections in 1993 were for the world population to double from the current 5.5 billion to 11 billion by 2050. Nearly 95% of the projected rise would come from developing countries, despite successes that many Asian and Latin American countries have had in bringing down their birth rates. Because of emigration and limited natural resources, all countries will feel the effects of growth. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest fertility rates, averaging more than 6 children per woman. Zimbabwe has a particularly high birth rate with many girls giving birth to their first child in their early teens. The Mexican government is battling huge population growth in a strongly Catholic country. The successful lowering of birth rates in countries such as China, India, Iran, Tunisia, Egypt, and Brazil are worth noting. The low birth rates in these countries and in Western Europe have slowed world population growth. In Tunisia, for example, government efforts to educate women and bring them into the workforce helped lower birth rates to 1.9 % per woman. In all of these countries success was achieved through education about family planning and availability of contraceptive devises. China's \"one child\" policy has kept population growth down to the same 1.9% as in western Europe. However, Kerala, India has been able to reduce its birth rate to the same percentage as China's without state coercion. Western Europeans countries are experiencing a \"baby bust\" with extremely low birth rates in all countries except Ireland and Poland."]}

In Tanzania, Zambia, Zaire and Sudan over 50% of their elephant population was killed in the 1980s. Zimbabwe lost 75% of its black rhino population to poachers. Elephants are valued for their ivory tusks and rhinos for their horns which China values for medicinal use. Measurers taken to protect these species have included making safe havens for the animals, making ivory trade illegal, dehorning rhinos to decrease their value to poachers, jailing and even shooting poachers, providing economic incentives and promoting conservation. In the western United States poachers have sought body parts of various raptors, including hawks and eagles. Law enforcement is emphasized to combat these illegal activities. In New England, authorities have broken-up a syndicate which poached black bears for their gallbladders which have medicinal value in the Far East. Poaching is a concern in Poland regarding bison, but efforts are made to protect yet limit numbers of Europe's largest beast. India has launched a national campaign called \"Project Tiger\" to protect these animals whose skins, along with leopards and other cats, are sought for fur. Tiger bones are used in medicine in Asia and in Chinese communities around the world.", "The African elephant, black rhinoceros, white rhinoceros, and, to a lesser extent the leopard, lion and antelope are all endangered in east and central Africa. Kenya established armed security forces in its reserves and strongly supported an international ban on the ivory trade, reducing decimation of the elephant and rhino population. Zimbabwe introduced a novel program of sedating rhinos, removing their horns and releasing them, reducing poachers' incentive to kill and instituted monetary incentives for rural inhabitants to protect animals regarded as pests. Zambia auctions off hunting rights and pays local citizens to protect the rhino. The tiger is still endangered in India despite the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species agreed to in 1973. The endangered bison in Poland was protected in nature reserves and has now been reestablished with some exports and hunting permitted. In the United States poachers in Massachusetts killed more than 400 black bears before the ring was broken with the arrest of 11 people and in California game wardens received special military and zoological training to control poaching on birds of prey and other species. In Rwanda Dian Fossey tried to protect a dwindling population of mountain gorillas by threatening local poachers with black magic, torturing, kidnapping their children and urging killing of poachers on sight, but the number of gorillas continued to decline. In China 400% of the world's remaining pandas are in six reserves but their number continues to decrease.", "After a brief golden age for elephants in the 1950s and 60s following the establishment of national parks in Africa, a wave of poaching spread from east Africa, driven by the high ivory price worldwide. Poaching extended far west through the equatorial forests and south to the Zambezi River. In Murchison Falls National Park, there were only 2,300 survivors from 14,000 elephants in the 1960s. Finally, in 1989, the evidence of abuse persuaded African and Western publics to back a ban on the ivory trade. Contrary to predictions, it proved enforceable. In most countries the ivory price dropped, followed by a decrease in poaching in parks and reserves. By 1993, trafficking in wildlife was on the rise again. Zambia arrested 1,500 poachers and seized more than 2,000 automatic weapons. Uganda suffered a growing trade in chimpanzees and rare birds. Swaziland lost 60 percent of its white rhino population. Mozambique became a free-for-all for poaching gangs. Many poor African countries lack incentives to keep poachers dealing in ivory and rhino horn out of parks. In the 1980s, four countries, Tanzania, Zambia, Zaire and Sudan, lost 750,000 elephants. All spent less than $20 per square kilometer on park management. Zimbabwe, by contrast, spent $194 and saw its elephant stock rise by over 20,000. If the African elephant is to be saved, said one expert, the economic return on elephant protection must be increased, perhaps by granting export quotas to countries willing to invest in keeping the poachers out.", "Poaching is the illegal killing or taking of endangered wildlife. Poached animals are used for food, clothing, medicine, jewelry, and trophies; live animals are supplied to the pet trade and to zoos. African elephants are poached for their tusks and are killed as pests because they trample on crop fields. Both black and white rhinos in Africa are hunted for their horns sold in the Far East for their aphrodisiac properties. Tigers in India are poached for their skins and to meet a demand for tiger bone used in Chinese medicine. Giant Pandas in China are poached, as are bison in Poland. Black bears in the Northeastern US are killed for their gall bladders used in the Far East as an aphrodisiac. Raptors are killed in Nevada for body parts, such as golden eagle feathers and hawk talons, to use as decorative trophies. Infant mountain gorillas in Rwanda are stolen to supply zoos, and adult gorillas are killed for food and use as trophies. A variety of steps are being taken to prevent poaching of endangered species. International bans have been placed on elephant poaching, and conventions have been signed that prohibit trading in tusks and tiger bone. Preserves have been established where wildlife is protected. Law enforcement against poachers has been strengthened with shoot-to- kill policies and with aerial monitoring of known poaching areas. There are efforts to reduce demand for animal parts by toughening and enforcing import controls and efforts to reduce supply, such as by dehorning rhinos.", "In Africa, species endangered by poaching include elephants, rhinoceroses, buffalo, baboons, chimpanzees, mountain gorillas and rare birds. Endangered in India are tigers, leopards, other cats, elephants, rhinoceroses, and numerous other species. China's giant pandas and eastern Poland's bison are endangered. In the US, poachers endanger black bears for their gall bladders and birds of prey for their body parts (hawk talons, golden eagle feathers, great horned owl heads). Blue and humpback whales are endangered. To prevent poaching, wildlife is guarded in parks. Bans have been imposed on big game hunting (Kenya), commercial whaling, trade in ivory, and possession of birds of prey or their body parts (US). Kenya and Zimbabwe instituted shoot-to-kill policies toward poachers. India instituted Project Tiger. China restricted wildlife trade. The US trained wildlife wardens. African countries created a regional task force to fight trade in contraband. Poaching rings were broken in India, the US and Namibia. International groups provide financial and monitoring support. Zimbabwe legally dehorns rhinos and sells low-priced horn to remove poaching's profit. Economic incentives include Zimbabwe's CAMPFIRE project which allows districts so many animal kills annually, encouraging protection of game quotas for high-profit safari hunting; and the South African-based Conservation Corporation which attracts development and investment funds and gets money circulated locally to show that conservation is in the people's interest. Anti-poaching publicity has appeared in books and movies, like \"Battle for the Elephants\", \"The Last Elephant\", and \"Gorillas in the Mist\". Dian Fossey fought off poachers with witchcraft and confronted European zoos.", "Poachers have endangered wildlife mostly in Africa. Countries where elephants are poached for their ivory tusks include Zambia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Countries where rhinos are poached for their horns include Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, and Swaziland. In Rwanda, mountain gorillas are poached to steal infants for zoos, and for natives who collect the skulls. In India, tigers, leopards, and other cats are poached for fur, and small animals for meat. Other animals which are poached include bison in Poland, giant pandas in China, and whales in the ocean. A major help in preventing poaching is the 1989 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which banned trade in ivory. Law enforcement officers from nine African countries met to create a task force to fight international crime syndicates dealing in ivory, and rhino horns. Zimbabwe and Namibia have rhino dehorning programs to remove the incentive to poach. Zimbabwe's Communal Areas Management Program for Indigenous Resources links cash with conservation, enabling rural communities to make money from animals which had been poached as pests. South Africa encourages keeping animals alive to attract tourists. Arrested poachers are reformed in the Conservation Corps and turned into honorary gamekeepers. Namibian police smashed a major international syndicate smuggling tusks. Zambian villagers set up security committees to prevent poachers entering their area. Kenya's elaborate security network ensures tourists' safety and comfort, and it established a shoot-to-kill policy against poachers. Poland created a bison reserve, and now exports bison to other regions of Poland and abroad.", "Poaching of elephants and black rhinos in central and southern Africa has been a serious problem. Over 700,000 elephants were lost to poachers collecting tusks for the valuable ivory. Three quarters of Zimbabwe's rhino herds were wiped out. In Asia powdered rhino horn is thought to increase sexual potency. Yemen purchases the horns for sword handles. The 1989 international trade ban on ivory cut down significantly on the loss of the elephant population. Pouching is difficult to control because it provides immediate financial rewards to an impoverished population. Kenya has been trying to protect its wildlife by offering financial incentives to local people through tourism, allowing limited hunting for food and protection of farmland, and support of small eco-culture businesses. Large cats and some species of deer have also fallen victim to poachers. Rwanda was losing its gorilla population to poachers who seized infants to send to zoos while slaughtering the adults. Gorilla skulls were sold to native collectors. In the Indian wildlife reserves of Ranthambhore, poachers hunted tigers, leopards, and other cats for their furs. A national campaign, Project Tiger, has succeeded in protecting the tiger population, now on the increase. In China, poaching is one factor for the decreasing number of pandas. Even in the US poaching is a problem, particularly of birds of prey whose talons and feathers are considered collectors items. In Northeastern US, more than 400 black bears were killed for their gall bladders which are prized as aphrodisiacs in the Far East.", "Poaching endangers wildlife in many areas of the world. In sub-Saharan Africa, elephants and rhinos are the primary victims but gorillas, hippos, chimpanzees and rare birds are also prey. Asian victims include tigers, leopards, and other cats in India and giant pandas in China. In Poland, the bison are threatened and, in the United States, black bears and birds of prey (hawks, eagles and owls) are killed. After establishing wildlife reserves and tough protective laws, there are four general steps to reducing poaching. These are to improve enforcement of national rules, maintain international bans against trade of products, reduce the demand, and place increased pressure on governments still letting banned products be imported. In Africa, improved enforcement has included more wildlife agents and game wardens, using reconnaissance vehicles and airplanes, going after bandits, high fines, and a shoot-to-kill policy. Trade in internationally banned items, especially by smuggling rings, must be stopped and stiff jail sentences imposed. An international task force was being formed in Africa. Demand can be reduced through tough import controls and public information campaigns, such as a National Audubon Society movie. In Africa, unique tactics to reduce poaching include dehorning wild rhinos and having controlled culling and state run hunting safaris. India instituted \"Project Tiger\" as a national campaign to save their cats in 1973. In both India and Africa, efforts have been made to make protection of wildlife an economic advantage to their human neighbors by hiring locals (even former poachers) as game wardens and guards.", "Poachers seriously endanger wildlife around the world. In Africa where extensive anti-poaching programs are constantly applied, most of the poaching focuses on elephants and rhinos whose ivory tusks are smuggled out through various African countries. It is then shipped to Asia, primarily for use in medicines, and to Europe and America for making high-priced trinkets and name stamps. In the 1970s and 1980s, Kenya's elephant herd was cut from 65,000 to 17,000. It has responded with a shoot-to-kill policy against poachers and the creation of an elaborate security network, including aerial surveillance of its parks. It is encouraging outside financial support to fund elephant protection programs within aid packages. In 1989, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) led by Kenya, banned the trade in ivory, and nine African nations are planning a regional task force to fight international crime syndicates dealing in ivory and rhino horns. Kenya is also considering the \"privatization\" of wildlife preserves by allowing quasi-private companies to run them with local farmers and hunters. Similarly, Zimbabwe has a newly developed program whereby locals are allowed to shoot a certain number of animals that they sell for meat, skin, or safari trophies. China is carefully guarding its ever-diminishing panda population. Poland faces some poaching of its rare bison population. In the US, Massachusetts' wildlife authorities have recently broken a poachers' ring that slaughtered some 400 black bears. Also, California and Nevada have specially-trained wardens known as \"poacher pinchers\" to protect their fish and wildlife domains."]}

Each seems to be encountering problems of a financial, humanitarian, environmental, or political nature. Dam and hydroelectric projects are currently proposed for China's Yangtze River, in Kenya, in Mexico, in Quebec, in Southern Turkey, in Malaysia, in Slovakia on the Danube River, in Chile, in India on the Narmada River, in Iran, on the Parana River bordering Argentina and Paraguay, in Nepal, in Portugal, and in the Mekong Delta by Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Ecologists and environmentalists have objected to most of these projects because they will greatly alter the existing ecosystem. In Vietnam, the spawning grounds of 90%of the region's fish could be destroyed. Environmentalists also foresee destruction of forests as a problem, particularly in Chile. Environmentalists claim that some cases, such as the Mekong project, danger of serious flooding could increase. Projects in China, Malaysia, Quebec, and India would all result in lose of homeland of indigenous populations. The Mexican project would destroy archeological sites. Several dam projects have created serious controversies between nations. Hungary has objected to Slovakia's diverting of the Danube River and is threatening reprisals if the project goes through. Financial problems have plagued most of the dam sites. Kenya's project has led to questions about payments to consultants for study of the proposal. Turkey's economy has been strained by the massive costs of its hydroelectric project with many economists believing that it is the cause of Turkey's 70% rate of inflation.", "A major obstacle for hydroelectric projects is opposition from environmental groups. Projects encountering this problem include China's Three Gorges project on the Yangtze River, Hydro-Quebec's Great Whale River project in Canada, Mexico's Rio Usumacinta dam, Chile's Pangue Project on the Bo-Bo River, Malaysia's Bakun project, India's Narmada River project, and Nepal's Arun project. Finance is another problem. Often, environmental opposition makes the World Bank reluctant to fund projects. High costs have delayed China's Three Gorges project, Kenya's Ewaso Ngiro project, Argentina's and Paraguay's Yacyreta dam, Nepal's Arun project, Turkey's south-east Anatolian project, and Iran's planned Karun River projects. Projects encounter opposition over the displacement of people or the destruction of cultural and historic resources. China's Three Gorges project would displace many people in Sichuan Province. Mexico postponed its Rio Usumacinta dam partly because of the possibility of flooding Mayan cities. Canada's Great Whale River project is opposed by the province's aboriginal community. Malaysia's Bakun project poses many technical and ecological challenges, as well as the possibility of damaging a unique tribal culture. Political issues plague many projects. The Yacyreta dam was delayed by Argentina's numerous political and economic crises. Malaysia's Pergau project is opposed by the state government of Kelantan. Hungary considers Slovakia's attempt to divert the River Danube to its own Cunovo project a territorial violation. Turkey's south-east Anatolian project poses political problems with Syria and Iraq. Projects which haven't encountered such difficulties include Portugal's Vila Nova de Foz Coa dam, China's Xiaolangdi project, and Paraguay's Corpus Cristi dam.", "New hydroelectric projects pose social, political, economic and environmental problems. China's Three Gorges project on the Yangtse would: displace 1.13 million people; do major social and environmental damage to Sichuan province while providing the most benefits to Hubei province; and be of enormous expense. In Malaysia The Pergau project pits its secular national government against Kilantan state's Islamist rulers. In Sarawak the Bakun project would displace 8,000 tribespeople from rainforest which could become an \"ecological time bomb\". The Narnada River project in northeastern India divides the three states involved and endangers the environment. The Arun River project in northern Nepal raises questions of costs versus benefits. Disputes over sharing river water bedevil the Bos Gablikova project on the Danube (Slovakia vs. Hungary), the GAP project in southeastern Turkey (Turkey vs. Syria and Iraq) and the Mekong River projects (Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos). Iran's Karun River project needs foreign financing as does Kenya's Evaso-Hgiro River project. Mexico's Rio Usumacinta project would flood ancient Mayan cities and threaten rainforest and its resident Indian tribe while the Pangue project on Chile's Bo-Bo River poses danger to a delicate ecosystem and the culture of the Pehuenche Indians. The Yacreta dam on the Parana River between Paraguay and Argentina caused years of political squabbles between the two countries. Paraguay needs private financing of its Corpus Cristi Dam while Canada's Great Whale River project faces opposition from environmentalists and Quebec's aboriginal community while there is reduced demand for electricity.", "In Asia, China is planning to build the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River and another on the Yellow River; India is building a dam on the Narmada River; Iran is planning four dams on the Karun River; Malaysia is planning a dam at Bakun in Sarawak on Borneo and another on the Pergau River; Laos is planning 58 dams on the Meking River; Nepal is planning a dam on the Arun River; and Turkey is planning the 22-dam Gap Project, the centerpiece of which is the Ataturk dam under construction. In Africa, Kenya is planning three dams on the Ewaso Ngiro River. In Europe, Portugal is planning a dam at Vila Nova de Foz Coa, and Slovakia is planning a dam on the Danube River. In the Western Hemisphere, Canada is planning a dam on the Quebec's Great Whale River; Mexico is planning a dam on Rio Usamacinta River; Chile is building the Pangue dam on the Bo-Bo River, one of six planned; and Paraguay together with Argentina are building the Yacyreta dam on the Paraha River and are planning another, the Corpus Cristi dam. Problems associated with the projects include the need to resettle people; environmental consequences, such as the destruction of rainforests; flooding issues, such as downriver flooding and flooding of important archeological sites; dependence on foreign capital, technologies and parts; and conflicts with neighboring states and countries because rivers flowing into them are being diverted, possibly affecting their power sources or causing silt accumulation."]}
{"id": "D0603C", "query": "Why are wetlands important? Where are they threatened? What steps are being taken to preserve them? What frustrations and setbacks have there been?", "summaries": ["The term \"wetlands\" describes marshes, swamps, bogs and similar areas usually situated between dry land and bodies of water. They play important roles in filtering and cleansing water, preventing soil erosion, preventing soil and water pollution, serving as a reservoir for flood waters and in harboring fish, shellfish, wild plants, migratory birds, waterfowl and tiny organisms essential to the food chain. Wetlands, so important to humans as well as wildlife, are endangered by human draining and development in many parts of the world. The demand for more farmland, roads, houses and commercial or industrial development leads to destruction of wetlands. More than half of the wetlands in the U.S. have been lost since the late 1700's. The remaining 100million acres are being depleted at the rate of 100,000 acres per year. International efforts to protect wetlands are based on the Ramsar Convention of 1971 which gained 90 signatory nations. In 1996 at a follow-up Ramsar Convention conference delegates from 120 countries launched the Wetlands International. Active programs to protect wetlands are underway in countries as varied as China, Vietnam, India, Uganda and the United States. In the U.S. early efforts of the Environmental Protection Agency and environmental groups were thwarted by the Army Corps of Engineers which was more compliant to the wishes of builders than to environmental regulations. By 2000, however, the Corps began stricter enforcement of the permitting system to protect wetlands and a program to restore the damaged wetlands of the Everglades was underway.", "The Wetlands are a natural ecological system sometimes called \"Earth's kidney\". Once thought to be useless mud, they are now known as important as filters for water prior to entering rivers and lakes. They serve as a habitat for numerous varieties of flora and fauna, many of which are quite rare. Wetlands are important for flood prevention and impact climate, water preservation, soil erosion, and pollution. Population increase and industrialization reduce the amounts of wetland acreage. Even in underdeveloped countries the increase of such activities as grazing, brick-making, rice-planting, hunting, and tree-cutting have negative impacts on wetlands. The launch of Wetlands International, an international conservation body, in 1996, represents a partnership between government and non-government interests with the goal of wetlands conservation. Efforts around the world include abuse hot lines and swamp-draining prohibitions by Uganda. China has established wetland reserves and is developing a monitoring network and scientific study of wetlands, as well as programs at local government levels for educating the public about natural resources. The Nethrlands and Finland are funding programs in Uganda and China respectively. The World Bank is approving loans to Vietnam for wetlands protection and development projects. In the U.S. the Corps of Engineers is issuing new regulations to make it harder to build roads or homes near wetlands. Several states have projects for creating manmade wetlands. Frustrations include unspecific language in the Clean Water Act, restrictions that stifle development, concerns over property rights, budget cuts, increasing workload on Corps of Engineers, and fuzzy math.", "Wetlands, called earth's kidney, are important in filtering pollutants, regulating climate, conserving water, preventing erosion, controlling floods, and preserving biodiversity. They can be low-cost extensions of wastewater treatment plants. Wetlands are of vital economic importance to Asia. Human activities threaten wetlands in many places, including Asia, Africa, and the US, where 100,000 acres per year have been lost. The 1971 Ramsar Convention, aiming to conserve wetland habitats and enhance international cooperation, has 90 signatory countries. In 1996 Wetlands International linked government and NGO groups to work for conservation. Countries are raising public awareness of wetlands' importance. In 1996 Uganda established an environmental abuse reporting hot line and banned new draining of swamps for development. China established over 130 wetland nature reserves since 1982 and increased wetland protections. International help with wetland restoration has come from the Netherlands, Finland, and the World Bank. In the US, the 1972 Clean Water Act mandated Corps of Engineers regulation of wetlands. The ineffective nationwide permit system was tightened in 1996 to require individual permits for projects of 3-acres instead of 10, then in 2000 half an acre, and one-tenth an acre in the NY City watershed. Closer scrutiny was required. Developers who damaged wetlands were required to create new ones. Declarations of critical habitat for wildlife also limited development. Illegal projects have been shut down and fined. Protecting wetlands has been hindered by insufficient enforcement; pressure from politicians, developers and industry; and resistance of residents. Side effects have included mosquito breeding and beaver damage.", "Wetlands are bodies of land under water at least part of the year, and include marshland, lakes, rivers, and swamps. They are important natural ecological systems that provide social, economic, and ecological benefits. They play a role in controlling floods, conserving water, preventing soil-erosion, disposing of sewage, filtering of waste, adjusting the climate, and in hosting a great variety of plants and waterfowl. Wetlands are threatened worldwide because of construction, increased water consumption, and climate changes. Though precise figures are unavailable, estimates are that wetlands in the US are disappearing at the rate of about 70,000 to 100,000 acres a year. To preserve wetlands, counties such as China have ratified the Ramsat Convention on Wetlands. China has increased public awareness of the importance of wetland protection. It has begun efforts on the proper use and management of wetland resources and on enforcing environmental protection standards. It intends setting up nature reserves for wetlands and funding wetland-related research. Uganda ratified the Ramsat treaty and has made efforts to raise public awareness about uses of wetlands. In the US, new regulations were issued making it harder to build roads or homes near wetlands. Efforts to preserve wetlands have encountered setbacks. In the US, the Army Corps of Engineers has retreated from enforcing the main law protecting wetlands. In their defense, Corps officials cited budget freezes and pressure from headquarters to provide greater fairness to developers. A loophole in the Clean Water Act led to the destruction of some 20,000 acres of wetlands."]}
{"id": "D385G", "query": "What is the current status of research and development on electric automobiles? What are the positive and negative factors for their usage? Which companies are involved in their development?", "summaries": ["Huge research efforts in viable electric cars has been going on the past several years. Carmakers around the world see electric vehicles as the only available technology to provide immediate pollution-free driving. A sense of urgency was prompted by the California legislature's calling for 2% of car manufacturers' sales to be of \"zero-emission vehicles\" from 1998, rising to ten percent by the 21st century. Up to twelve other states are seriously considering adopting similar requirements. The electric car is considered by many to be cheap to run, virtually silent, non-polluting, and easy to drive, providing good acceleration and reasonable highway cruising. Nearly all major car manufacturers -- GM, Ford, Chrysler, Daimler-Benz, Renault, Peugot, Ford, VW, and BMW, have made battery-powered conversions of their smaller gasoline-powered cars and delivery vehicles and are preparing plants for increased production. GM unveiled its prototype of a futuristic electric car developed from the Impact model. Severe disadvantages in manufacturing electric cars at this time are delaying extensive production. They are low on power, short of range, and expensive to make. The cost of high technology required to eliminate these problems will make them highly expensive to purchase. The biggest problem is the absence of super-efficient batteries. The industry must use cheap-lead acid batteries, which are extremely heavy and take up the rear seat space. GM, Ford, Chrysler, and federal agencies are collaborating to establish new super battery technology. For the immediate future the hybrid car, using both electricity and gasoline, is showing the most promise.", "Partly prompted by California's zero emission standards, practically every American and European car manufacturer was involved in researching and designing electric cars in the early 1990s. Electric cars were considered to have the advantage of reducing air pollution and reducing noise. The concept had been around for a long time, but there were still many problems to be addressed. The most difficult technical problem involves the battery. A conventional storage battery is an inefficient form of propulsion, but more efficient batteries are too heavy and take up too much space leaving at most room for two persons in a vehicle. Other major practical drawbacks of electric cars are the limited distance that can be traveled before recharging is required, usually under 90 miles, and the current expense of the vehicle, approximately twice the cost of a fuel-driven car. Ironically, many environmentalists claim that use of electric cars will not solve pollution problems, but merely transfer the source of the problem from the vehicles themselves to electric power stations. Research efforts have concentrated on designing batteries which would increase speed, power, and driving range. Research is also ongoing on the shape of the vehicle to provide maximum comfort and the ability to carry several passengers or equipment. As of the early 1990s, an electric car could probably only serve as a second car used for short trips in the city. Designers have also been experimenting with hybrid cars that combine fossil fuel or hydrogen with electric power.", "The electric car was coming into sight in 1994 in the U.S., but it was low on power, short of range and expensive to make. General Motors introduced the \"Impact\" electric, and trials were just getting underway. GM was collaborating with Ford and Chrysler in pursuit of a viable EV. Were it not for California's clean-air legislation requiring two percent of each manufacturer's sales to be of zero-emission vehicles (Zevs) from 1998, 10 percent by 2003, it seemed unlikely that the battery-powered car would be a candidate for volume production in the near future in the U.S. But in Europe, Peugeot said it planned soon to produce electric cars at an initial rate of 5,000 a year. Some 20 French towns were being equipped to recharge them. In 1994, Despite intensive research and heavy expenditures, the search for a \"super battery\" capable of giving an electric vehicle (EV) anything like the speed and range of a gasoline car had failed. GM and several other car makers signed with the Ovonic battery company to produce nickel-hydride batteries. The environmental impact of EVs was questioned. Electric power for EV's battery has to be generated by coal, oil, natural gas, hydro or nuclear energy, etc. Ford and several European companies argued that ultra-low (but not zero) emission \"hybrid\" cars should be considered as an effective compromise. Their small gasoline engine keeps batteries charged when running on the open road (overcoming the range problem) but can switch to battery-only operation in urban areas.", "Electric automobiles were in existence more than a century ago. Weight for weight they could not compete with gasoline-powered cars so they soon lost favor. In the 1990s, California adopted clean air standards whereby any 2% of cars sold in that state by a major manufacturer must be zero emissions vehicles. This has led to revived interest in electric automobiles so that every major automobile company is planning for an electric model. Those companies include: BMW, GM, Ford, FIAT, Peugeot, Renault, Citroen and Mercedes. Electric cars are quiet and operating them does not cause any air pollution. The drawback to electric cars has always been that batteries necessary for operation are large and heavy and require frequent recharging. The driving range before recharging is not great and recharging stations are few and far between. Many improvements in batteries have been made but they remain larger and heavier than a gas tank. The appropriate venue for the electric assessed to be for within city driving. One promising development is the so-called hybrid car that uses a low powered gasoline to charge the car's electrical operating system."]}

As early as December, 1992, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, of GM, was in touch with Ferdinand Piech, Chairman of Volkeswagen, about coming to work for VW. Lopez was procurement chief at Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary. Lopez was disappointed by GM's decision not to build an automobile plant in his own Basque country. VW offered to build it. He left GM for VW in March, 1993. He also took, according to considerable evidence, many GM documents, along with seven GM executives. In April, 1993, witnesses in Wiesbaden allegedly saw documents being shredded by Jorge Alvarez Aquirre and Rosario Piazza, two Lopez associates. In four remaining boxes, investigators found details of Opel secret car plans. A VW employee said she had punched Opel data into the VW computer. In July, the U.S. Justice Department announced it was investigating the Lopez case. At a VW meeting in August, 1993, Lopez contradicted his earlier public claim that he never took any secret documents and said that papers from his former offices were destroyed in order to keep them from being circulated within VW. Investigations continued. In May, 1994, Lopez agreed to pay 29,850 pounds to avoid facing perjury charges in court. Through October, 1994, no legal action had been taken against Lopez or Volkswagen.", "Jose Lopez as head of purchasing at Adam Opel, GMs German subsidiary, led the company to become the most profitable car maker in that country. He was made procurement chief at GM headquarters. However, he left GM for VW under circumstances, which along with ensuing events, were described by a German judge as \"potentially the biggest-ever case of industrial espionage\". Ferdinand Piech took over an ailing VW company that was losing money. He is accused of luring Lopez away from GM along with several of Lopez' key associates. Lopez, disappointed that GM was not going to build a plant in his native Basque country, left GM under a cloud of confusion and allegedly took some sensitive GM documents and plans with him. Lopez also requested documents from Adam Opel that later turned up in the Wiesbaden home of a Lopez colleague who followed him to VW. Still Later German police raided VW headquarters and seized documents that were later founds to contain Opel plans. Months of charges and counter-charges followed and details were aired in German newspapers. German economics minister Gunter Rexrodt was concerned of damage to US-German political and business relations and for a time tried to be a peacemaker. PM Gerhardt Schroeder of Lower Saxony, VW's largest shareholder, strongly supported VW. Lopez agreed to pay DM75,000 instead of facing perjury charges in court. Criminal investigations in Germany and the US relating to suspected industrial espionage, theft, perjury and wire fraud are still in progress.", "On April 30, 1993 Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors, asked public prosecutors in Darmstadt to investigate its suspicions of industrial espionage by Volkswagen. The suspicions were occasioned by the sudden departure of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua from his position as GM's global purchasing director in Detroit, his arrival in Wolfsburg as VW's purchasing and production director, the disappearance of secret and confidential documents from his office in Detroit, the sudden departure of six of Lopez's associates from GM/Opel and arrival at VW, and reports of night-long document shredding by two of these associates in Wiesbaden. On May 25th the prosecutors announced that they had enough evidence to launch an investigation. David Herman, chairman of Adam Opel, accused Lopez of using GM secrets in developing plans for a VW car plant in Spain. Ferdinand Piech, chairman of VW, denied having any confidential GM documents. In July the U.S. Justice Department revealed that it was investigating the case and German investigators in Darmstadt announced that boxes recovered in Wiesbaden from an apartment occupied by two of Lopez's colleagues contained secret plans for a new GM mini-car. Over the next fifteen months Dorothy Holland carried out the German investigation accumulating a mountain of evidence, but by October 1984 no charges were made. Meanwhile U. S. officials pursued possible mail and wire-fraud charges, but had problems getting evidence gathered by the German investigation. The prospect was for more delay, more frustration for GM and relief for VW.", "On March 16, 1993, with Japanese car import quotas to Europe expiring in two years, renowned cost-cutter, Agnacio Lopes De Arriortua, left his job as head of purchasing at General Motor's Opel,Germany, to become Volkswagen's Purchasing and Production Director. GM charged that during his last months at GM, Lopez stole GM plans for ultra-low cost factories; designs for advanced cars and engines; and information about Opel's suppliers and parts. A regional court in Frankfurt issued an injunction preventing VW from recruiting more GM staff. All charges of anti-competitive staff poaching were later dismissed. VW failed to get court injunctions preventing Der Spiegel magazine from publishing GM's allegations. Darmstadt, Germany investigator, Dorothea Holland, launched still unresolved investigations into charges of industrial espionage, theft, and perjury against Lopez, his 22-year old daughter, Begounia, and other GM colleagues now at VW. VW counter-charged that GM had planted GM documents and data in VW sites and computers. The FBI opened still unresolved investigations of wire and mail fraud against VW and Lopez. European government and industry leaders expressed fear that defensive allegations by VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech, that the Lopez incident amounted to U.S. industrial warfare against Germany, would destabilize U.S.-European commercial and diplomatic relations. U.S. Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, suggested that relations between the U.S. and Germany would be damaged if German investigators don't immediately deliver long promised data and assistance in the GM/VW case. So far, Lopez has agreed to pay DM75,000 to set aside the perjury case against him.", "General Motors Corporation and Volkswagen were warring in 1993 and 1994. VW chairman Ferdinand Piech recruited the General Motors/Opel executive, Jose Lopez de Arriortua. In March 1993, Lopez and seven other GM executives moved to VW overnight. GM immediately accused Lopez of looting Opel's supply network and contract database and taking secret plans for a high-speed factory and a new Opel mini-car. VW and Lopez also were accused on conducting an illegal recruiting campaign. German officials began investigating VW for theft and industrial espionage. With GM urging, a temporary injunction was imposed on VW recruiting, but it was subsequently lifted and manager-poaching claims against VW were rejected. GM documents and computerized information were seized from a VW headquarters and documents were found at the apartment of the former GM executives, Jorge Alvarez Aquirre and Rosario Piazza. The German economics minister, Gunter Rexrodt, had tried to be a peacemaker is this controversy, but in September 1993 withdrew. Lopez was accused of perjury and in May 1994 agreed, while maintaining his innocence, to pay a DM75,000 fine to avoid facing charges in court The German prosecutor, Dorthea Holland, was searching through an estimated 2 million computer printout sheets. Because of leaks, a gag was placed on her office in October 1994 and no information was expected until a decision to indict Lopez was reached. The U.S. Justice Department's interest in industrial espionage had been piqued and the FBI began an investigation of mail and wire fraud, which was also stalled.", "The industrial espionage battle by General Motors (GM) and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel, against Volkswagen (VW) for the past 18 months has bogged down in mountains of paper and a complex transatlantic tussle involving both lawyers and politicians. Germany, increasingly concerned about the effect of the court investigations on domestic economic and political affairs, is now also worried about Bonn's relations with Washington. A US probe of the investigation started at the instigation of the Commerce Department after President Clinton apparently decided that industrial espionage in general was a threat to America's well being. The FBI is probing possible mail and wire fraud. The issue stems from the alleged recruitment of GM's eccentric and visionary Basque-born procurement chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortura and seven of Lopez's business colleagues. He was presumably recruited by VW chairman, Ferdinand Piech, who was impressed with Lopez's leading role in helping Adam Opel recover from a major production cost disadvantage. He saw Lopez as the answer to a similar ongoing problem at VW. The investigation is focused mainly on evidence that Mr. Lopez and his associates took GM and Adam Opel industrial secrets with them. These included details of Opel's entire European component supplier network and key contact data, plans for a new style, low-cost high-speed car factory, and information on new models. Coincidentally, Lopez quit after being informed that a plan to install his new car dream plant in his Basque area was cancelled. The outcome of the investigation is still uncertain.", "Ferdinand Piech became Volkswagen chairman in January 1993 and planned to turn the money-losing company around. A ruthless restructurer, he recruited General Motors' likeminded global head of purchasing Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. Lopez had developed a new GM plant to be built in his native Basque country, but when he learned in March 1993 that it would be built in Hungary he abruptly left GM for VW, with secret GM documents he had requested that detailed GM's new plant and car models. Lopez was followed by seven top members of his team, including Jose Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez Aguirre, and Rosario Piazza. He tried to recruit others. Soon after Lopez's arrival, VW announced a new plant to be built in Basque country and a car similar to a planned GM model. Piech publicly accused GM/Opel of planting documents and hacking VW computers with the aim of destroying VW. This angered GM and led Germany to distance itself from Piech's damaging nationalistic tones. Piech's clumsy, halfhearted conciliation efforts failed. At GM's request, German state prosecutors and the FBI began investigations into industrial espionage, theft, perjury and wire fraud. GM wanted all former employees banned from working for VW for 12 months but settled for only some. VW was banned from further personnel poaching but a Frankfurt court denied that poaching broke fair competition rules. Lopez paid a fine instead of facing perjury charges. German politicians called the case biased and wanted it dropped. In October 1994 criminal charges were bogged down.", "General Motors and Volkswagen are enmeshed in a complicated legal battle over charges of industrial espionage. Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, GM's former procurement chief, and seven of his associates are under investigation. VW chief Ferdinand Piech lured Lopez and members of his GM buying team to VW in March 1993. Lopez left GM, disillusioned upon learning the company no longer intended to build a new super-efficient plant in his home town in Spain as planned. GM charges that Lopez and others systematically plundered GM industrial secrets before defecting to VW. A search of VW facilities turned up boxes of alleged secret GM documents, including plans for a top-secret mini-car model. Upon painstaking review of the documents, striking similarities were detected between VW's newly planned \"Plant B\" and GM's secret \"Plant X\". Progress in the case is slow, bogged down by the need for meticulous document review. GM is seeking retribution through the German and US courts. The US Justice Department's investigation adds a political dimension to the affair, as does the Bonn government's pressure for conciliation. So far, the German court has rejected GM's claim that VW broke laws in poaching its employee. However, the company was barred from trying to lure any more of GM's key German staff. Lopez was ordered to pay a fine to avoid facing perjury charges, but still faces mail and wire fraud charges. As the investigation continues, the US FBI has now been granted access to the German prosecutors' files.", "The industrial espionage case involving GM and VW began with the hiring of Jose Ignacio Lopez, an employee of GM subsidiary Adam Opel, by VW as production director. Ferdinand Piech had just been installed as Chairman of Volkswagen when he hired Lopez. Lopez brought with him to VW seven former GM employees including his close friend, Jorge Manuel Gutierrez. When GM protested the recruiting of their employees, private mediation was set up between the two companies. The situation became more serious when top- secret documents were found missing from GM that described plans to build a new model car. Then state prosecution officials discovered four boxes of papers, including secrets documents containing plans to build the car where Gutierrez and Piazza, another former GM employee were staying. This led to investigations and counter charges on both sides of the ocean followed by civil and criminal court cases. Lopez was found innocent during his first trial in Germany, but faced further charges. A court case was also brought against leading news magazine, Der Spiegel, for making public allegations of spying against Lopez. Der Spiegel later presented evidence in state court in a bid not to be stopped from reporting. The case reached the highest levels in both countries including the US Justice Dept. and the FBI investigating mail and wire fraud. The legal cases soon became bogged down in mountains of papers and transatlantic issues between the countries involving lawyers and politicians. As of October 1994, nothing had been resolved."]}
{"id": "D391H", "query": "What are the key activities in the research and development phase of creating new drugs?", "summaries": ["Research and development of drugs is a complex, drawn-out, and expensive process. Research is looking for a new drug. Once the process was random, with scientists experimenting in a laboratory to find a substance that worked. Now scientists must also have leading-edge computers and are doing molecular modeling and automatic gene sequencing. They also work closely with biotechnical engineering specialists, universities, and government research organizations. Once discovered, a drug must be synthesized and a delivery system determined. A patent is applied for. At this point, drug companies make the decision to develop or not. Is there a need? Will it make a notable contribution to treatment? Will it be a commercial success? The drug must pass the hurdles of safety, quality and efficacy. This is done with pre-clinical trials, then with clinical trials on humans. Profitable drugs are sold worldwide so trials must be conducted in the US, Europe, and Japan. Volunteers to take the drug must be recruited and detailed records kept and processed to create mountains of supporting documents to submit for licensing approval in a number of countries. The process now includes creating public pressure to support the drug, including getting good reviews in medical journals. The company will go forward with an appealing trade name and an attractive and entertaining application package. Worldwide marketing preparations will also be in place and production ready. Throughout, drug companies continue to lobby governments to reduce regulatory burdens. Extending the life of patents is also a key goal.", "The R&D phase of creating new drugs has become highly costly due primarily to the increasing complexity of the regulatory process, the rapid spread of biochemistry, and the expanding demand for innovative drugs. In the US, government pressure to keep drug prices down is causing large cutbacks in R&D spending. As a result of these developments, pharmaceutical companies have begun to focus closer attention on their R&D processes and to look for more feasible ways to manage them. Some pharmaceutical companies have cut back on the number of their R&D facilities and, in some cases, have consolidated them all into one location. Other changes involve joint R&D programs with other companies, with universities, and with bio-technical laboratories around the world. There are companies that have split the management of their R&D processes. Several changes have been made to cut down on the actual time of the R&D process which can take up to six or more years. Companies are learning to concentrate only on innovative drugs that seem certain to prove effective and to drop research on those taking too long to develop. In some cases, new timesaving computer processing equipment is being installed which quickly transfers information from paper to computer. There is also increasing use of computerized molecular design methods, which bind molecules to the protein. Drug companies are being transformed by breakthroughs in human gene therapy making it easier to apply therapeutic treatment. Companies in this regard are turning more attention to illnesses common to the elderly.", "The first phase in pharmaceutical research and development is the initial discovery of new chemical entities. Companies must decide which compounds to take forward, assessing the medical need and feasibility of each. Scientists are using computerized chemical databases, molecular modeling graphics, and automatic gene sequencing machines to rapidly select and adapt compounds for development. Economic units assess the cost and quality of life benefit of potential new drugs as early as possible. The second phase is clinical trials. These typically involve three phases, an average of 200 patients per trial, and are the longest, most costly stages in new drug development. This process must be conducted internationally, because US, Japanese and European authorities often require different clinical trials. Considerable data assembled from trials is subjected to detailed statistical evaluation and medical interpretation. Doctors and their patients are becoming more reluctant to take part, so companies must spend more time and money to recruit hundreds or thousands of people required. Computers are used to keep track of the immense volumes of patient data amassed, to obviate mountains of paperwork, and to cut approval times. The final phase, the regulatory and licensing process, has become increasingly complex and demanding. Drugs must go through these processes in individual countries at the same time. Currently, the development period for new drugs, from discovery to marketing, lasts about 12 years. Companies are working to shorten that period to an average of eight to nine years in the US and Europe, and 12 years in Japan.", "Drug research and development starts with a decision on which therapeutic area to target, based on medical need, potential market size, and understanding of the disease mechanism. Drug companies keep abreast of new discoveries and new technologies. Next, researchers select and adapt compounds for development as candidate drugs. Using computerized databases, molecular modeling graphics, automatic gene sequencing machines, and x-ray crystallography, they design drugs to react with target molecules. A company then decides which drug to develop, taking into consideration technological feasibility of producing it, whether it will provide significant advantages in safety or efficacy, and likelihood of commercial success. They overcome problems such as delivery into the body. Clinical studies are the most expensive and longest part of R&D, averaging 4-6 years, and are sometimes contracted out. Clinical trial preparation requires recruiting hundreds or thousands of volunteers (including sufficient candidate patients), manufacturing adequate supplies of the drug, and writing case study books. After toxicity tests on animals, drugs are tested for safety on healthy human volunteers. If the compound is not dropped at this point, it is tested for efficacy for the first time. Investigating doctors must sign all trial results. Patient data is computerized, evaluated statistically, and interpreted medically. Results must show that a drug has sufficient new value. Drugs must then be licensed for sale, sometimes requiring separate clinical trials in Japan, Europe and the US. Companies generate public pressure for licensing and try to make applications compelling reading. A typical drug takes 10 years to develop.", "In the pharmaceutical industry, the traditional way of beginning research and development calls for years of random testing. If something accidentally works, the company doing the research turns it into a drug. This takes an average of seven years, and the average cost is $220 million. In a new method, \"second generation biotech,\" a process called X-ray crystallography enables researchers to take a three-dimensional picture of a protein molecule. The photo is then entered onto a computer screen, where scientists design drugs they believe will react with the target molecule. After the pre-clinical phase, a potential drug goes into clinical trials. A typical trial involves three phases, with an average of 200 patients per trial. They take an average of four to six years, but may require as many as 10 years. Here, also, computer technology is used more and more to speed up the process. Merck's Clin*Net project allows managers to follow the progress of thousands of patients in clinical centers around the world far more effectively than mail or phone. Pen computers, electronic tablets used for writing on the screen, offer hope for obviating the mountains of paperwork associated with drug trials, especially in Phase II trials, where drugs are tested for efficacy for the first time Finally, drugs must go through expensive licensing procedures in individual countries. In support of its drug EPO, Amgen submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 40,000 pages of documents. Increasingly, regulatory requirements are delaying product launches.", "The research and development process for creating new drugs and releasing them to market consists of three steps: drug discovery; drug testing; and drug launching and continuing support. One group of activities involved in the process consists of mainly scientific efforts and a second group consists of efforts to manage the process. The aim of activities in the drug discovery step is to develop a product that satisfies an unmet need in an important therapeutic area. Scientists exhaustively test thousands of drugs to eliminate ineffective compounds and identify those potentially useful. Their activities can include using an automated testing system to screen compounds, performing searches of compound databases, applying molecular modelling techniques, using gene-splicing machines, and designing, by means of a computer-aided process, a drug that targets RNA responsible for synthesizing diseased protein. Drug testing activities deal with determining the efficacy and safety of a drug. It is the longest and most expensive aspect of drug development, involving years of preclinical and clinical tests on humans. When a drug is approved by regulatory agencies, it is released to the market with accompanying marketing activities. Continuing support activities include conducting clinical testing to determine long-term health effects of the drug and conducting studies to determine whether it can be used to treat other illnesses. Management activities include efforts to reduce drug development costs, such as by reducing the time between drug discovery and market release and by setting up clinical trials to be conducted simultaneously in the US, Europe, and Japan.", "The research and development phase for creating new drugs is costly and complicated. The pathology of the disease or condition for which the development of a new drug is contemplated must be understood. In this respect the cooperation of drug developers with microbiologists has become critical since the understanding the body's neurotransmitters and receptors as well as advances in identifying genetic coding aid in predicting a drug's efficacy. This cooperation helps the drug researcher in developing the specificity of a new drug and avoiding unpleasant side effects. Not all of the key activities in the research and development of new drugs take place in the laboratory. Since the development process is costly, sufficient funds need to be available for the process. Drug companies must be convinced that a market exists for the new product and that the pricing of the finished product will be sufficient to recoup the developmental expenditure. Cooperation with government and universities can sometimes yield added funds as well as aiding in the laboratory. Obtaining patent protection for the drug may also be a factor. Some drug companies have consolidated previous decentralized research and development facilities to make the process more efficient and less costly. Others have cut the number of compounds under development to concentrate efforts on the more promising drugs.", "Research and development of new drugs by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies consists of five interdependent activities. These are funding, facilities construction and staffing, basic science and technology research or acquisition, analysis of new medical therapy needs, and selection of newly found drugs for actual product development based on projected market analysis and expected regulatory approval. Profits are reinvested for R&D, but other sources include license sales, private investors, government subsidies, divestitures, lay-offs and overhead cuts. Stock flotation and preserving stock value by meeting market expectations about new drug developments are also important sources of capital. Drug companies build and staff their own multi-million dollar basic science and technology research facilities, but also outsource science research and acquire advanced technologies to manage risk and flexibly invest in infrastructure only as needed for profitable lines of development in dynamic markets. Research focuses on medical areas of great need where the company has unique and dominant technical and competitive competence. \"Me-too\" drugs similar to what is already on the market are developed only where there is a market advantage from improved safety, effectiveness or treatment cost-benefit. Drug companies make ruthless choices about which of their researched drugs will actually go into development. Prospective drugs must have high projected market share; expected superiority in safety, effectiveness, and cost-benefit; and quick profitability or long market life after regulatory approval. Companies will kill otherwise promising drugs which show poor results in early clinical trials. Some companies have separated research from development in order to expedite development.", "Because of the high cost of research and development of new drugs, pharmaceutical companies weigh the changes for commercial success before making a decision to proceed. Once the decision is made work begins on marketing arrangements to insure that costs of research and development are recovered. Most companies spend about 15% of sales on research and development. Because of the increasing complexity of pharmacological research, companies tend to specialize in areas such as: central nervous system; heart and lungs; anti-infectious; inflammation and tissue repair; and vaccines. Having decided on a target, researchers proceed to testing compounds using high tech equipment ranging from computerized chemical databases to molecular graphics and automatic gene sequencing machines. Selected compounds are tested for toxicity on animals and then run through clinical tests on humans. Computer technology has made testing more efficient but it is a very time-consuming process averaging seven years per drug in the early 1990's. Drugs for the treatment of AIDS, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are the subject of extensive research. Understanding of the chemistry and biology of the brain and functioning of neurotransmitters and receptors gives hope for treatment of migraine, anxiety, schizophrenia, addiction and age-associated memory loss. A whole new class of drugs that work directly on human genes is under development. Research on gene therapy is progressing quickly and anti-sense technology is under clinical testing and gives hope for cure of hepatitis B, AIDS and leukemia among others."]}

Include details about when the probe was launched and any troubles it may have encountered.", "summaries": ["The Galileo planet Jupiter space probe, launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis October 18, 1989, was released from Galileo July 13, 1996 and entered Jupiter's atmosphere December 7, 1997. It is the first manmade spacecraft to enter the atmosphere of a planet and send back data. By the end of 1999, the spacecraft has completed more than four years of orbiting Jupiter, collecting pictures and data, allowing the scientific community to develop valuable and surprising new insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system and the origins of life within it. The journey was a circuitous route dictated by power limitations at its sendoff, the failure of the main antenna to unfurl, erratic behavior of a tape recorder, and temporary shutdown of spacecraft instruments due to radiation zappings from Jupiter's radiation belts. Nevertheless, Galileo achieved 70% of its scientific goals during its $1.5 million primary mission throughout 1997. Its subsequent success in gathering data about Jupiter's four large moons - Ganymede, Europa, Callista, and IO - prompted an extension of the mission. The Galileo space probe indicated Jupiter formed as much as 10 times further from the sun than it is now, had wide variations in radiation levels, 400 mile winds, extremely high temperatures with constantly stormy weather generated by heat from nitrogen sources deep in the planet. The large moons have the highest temperatures in the solar system, many active volcanoes, and may have liquid oceans deep beneath their frozen surface, which possibly could support primitive organisms.", "The Galileo mission to Jupiter exceeded the most optimistic predictions. Data allowed new insights into our solar system's formation and evolution and the origins of life. Galileo is the first craft to enter a planet's atmosphere and send back data. Jupiter was found to be much hotter and windier than thought, with an atmospheric chemical composition closely resembling the sun's. Jupiter's surface energy comes from heat escaping from deep in the planet. Jupiter's rings, formed by cosmic debris smashing into moons, are more numerous and complex than thought. Jupiter was probably formed under cooler conditions. Jupiter's moons Europa and Callisto probably contain subsurface salty oceans. Europa may support life forms. Jupiter's gravity changes Europa's shape as it orbits. Europa's core is metallic, surrounded by rock, water, and ice. Its magnetic north pole reverses. Io has a giant iron core overlain by rock and over 100 active volcanoes. Ganymede has its own magnetic field, indicating a fluid metal core. Galileo was launched aboard space shuttle Atlantis in October 1989 and took six years to reach Jupiter. A probe was released from Galileo in July 1996, entering Jupiter's atmosphere December 7th and sending back data for 30 minutes. After two years studying Jupiter and its four largest moons, in 1998 Galileo's orbit was rerigged to focus on Europa for two more years. Galileo's main antenna failed to unfurl. In 1999 Galileo began experiencing instrument damage from Jupiter's intense radiation. By 2000 fuel was low and officials debated the cost-effectiveness of further operations.", "After a delayed launch on October 18, 1989, the Galileo probe arrived at Jupiter in December 1995. It made important discoveries about Jupiter and its four largest moons, Io, Ganymede, Europa and Callisto and extended its two year mission an additional two years. Observations forced revision of planetary evolution theories. There are lower than expected levels of helium, neon, carbon, oxygen and sulfur -- twice the expected argon and nitrogen. There is an intense radiation belt above Jupiter's clouds. Super lightening indicates copious water and strong convection driving super storms. Dust from moon impacts caused Jupiter's better imaged faint rings. Io's volcanoes -- the hottest in the solar system -- erased all craters with a red and yellow mineral surface. An iron core half its diameter, strong tidal forces from Jupiter and electric fields energize intense red, blue and green gaseous lights. Ganymede is the first moon in the solar system with its own strong magnetic strong, indicating a molten metal core. Heat-producing, reversing electro-magnetic fields, tidal forces from Jupiter and thousand-mile long scalloped ice cracks oozing salt deposits and possible organic compounds, indicate Europa may have a salty, carbonated subsurface ocean, possibly harboring simple life. Europa has Earth-like surface faults. Callisto has electro-magnetic field interactions with Jupiter, but no dense core or tidal forces. It may also have a subsurface ocean. After launch two antennas failed to open. By 1999 Galileo's gyros, computers and tape recorder had degraded. Galileo briefly entered safe-mode twice in 1999 and once in 2000.", "NASA's Galileo probe was launched by the Space Shuttle Atlantis on October 18, 1989. It arrived at Jupiter on December 7, 1995 and performed successfully on its original and extended missions. It defied expectations, transmitting stunning pictures and valuable data into the year 2000. Much was learned from Galileo. Its probe into Jupiter's atmosphere sent data on the composition of Jupiter's atmosphere which surprised scientists, possibly necessitating a reappraisal of existing views on the planet's evolution. Galileo's data showed that Jupiter is much hotter and windier than previously believed. It revealed that Jupiter's faint rings were formed when cosmic debris smashed into four small inner moons. Galileo sent back important data on Jupiter's moons. Volcano-pocked Io was found to have a giant iron core. Scientists learned that Io acts like an electrical generator as it intersects powerful magnetic field lines from the planet. This power causes Io to glow in Jupiter's shadow. Tidal forces from Jupiter create frictional heat that erupts in at least 32 volcanoes on Io. Galileo's data indicate Jupiter's moon Europa may have enough heat and water to support life. Scientists found evidence of a large ocean on Europa's the frozen surface. Galileo sent back data on Ganymede, Jupiter's biggest moon, and on the moon Callisto. Data indicate Callisto probably contains an ocean. Late in its mission, Galileo experienced a few minor computer problems, some caused by its exposure to Jupiter's radiation. Despite temporary, minor glitches, the probe operated successfully well beyond what scientists expected."]}

What supportive or critical statements or actions have come from Venezuelans or leaders of other countries?", "summaries": ["Anticipating Hugo Chavez as Venezuela's new President, investors caused the Caracas stock market to fall. But when Chavez promised he would not impose radical measures, the Caracas stock market jumped and the currency strengthened. He negotiated an extended international debt schedule. Chavez privatized three electric utilities, an aluminum plant, and sold government aircraft to finance social programs. He temporarily shutdown congress and promoted military officers without congressional approval, which critics called a \"coup d'etat\". In moves the Venezuelan Congress and Supreme Court considered unconstitutional, Chavez held referenda for a new constitution, a new congress without a Senate, a restructured judiciary, a presidency electable to two six-year terms. The army, no longer civilian controlled, became a defacto ruling party. Critics called it an \"elected dictatorship\". He raised the minimum wage and shrank the bureaucracy. Critics said laid-off government workers simply joined more than half the country in poverty. He raised oil prices, for which small U.S. companies sued. He forced oil production down by controlling management of Venezuela's national oil company. The CEO and other high-level executives resigned. Chavez continued a \"one-China\" policy. He fostered closer ties with Latina America, Caribbean and Andean countries. He supported Cuba against the U.S. embargo and voted against a U.N. resolution condemning Cuba's human rights violations, for which the U.S. cancelled economic consultations. Columbia criticized Venezuela's transfer of imported cargo to Venezuelan trucks. Venezuela denied U.S. over-flight permission for anti-drug campaigns in Columbia. In Chavez's first year, nearly $4 billion in foreign investment fled Venezuela.", "Hugo Chavez campaigned for president of Venezuela by deriding capitalism and free-market policies. He was determined to rebuild the impoverished country through political and social reforms. Peasants, shantytown dwellers, and the center-left Movement to Socialism party celebrated his election as a victory of the poor over a political elite. Chavez's bid to rewrite the Constitution was opposed by the establishment but overwhelmingly approved by voters. Chavez wanted to allow re-election of incumbents, extend the presidential term, root out corruption, raise the minimum wage, cut Venezuela's government payroll, reduce oil production, and restructure foreign debt. He denounced privatizing health care but sold off utilities and planes to reduce the deficit and finance social programs. Some Venezuelans criticized Chavez's circumvention of Congress, said his populist policies would push Venezuela backwards and harm the economy, and called him a power-seeking authoritarian. Others mildly praised him, reluctant to take on the highly popular president. Five state oil executives quit in a policy dispute. The stock exchange dropped after his election but then skyrocketed. Chavez wanted an increased Venezuelan role in a more unified Latin America and Caribbean and reduced US influence. He tightened ties with Cuba, called for the embargo to end, and urged defeat of a US-backed resolution criticizing Cuba's human rights, resulting in cancellation of planned economic consultations. Chavez refused US use of its airspace for anti-narcotics flights. Chavez was criticized by foreign companies adversely affected by his policies. China congratulated Chavez on his victory and invited him to visit.", "Hugo Chavez, who six years earlier staged an unsuccessful coup, won the presidency of Venezuela heading the Patriotic Pole Coalition. His election met with mixed reaction in the country and abroad. In Venezuela, there was dancing in the streets by peasants and shantytown dwellers, who viewed his election as a great populist victory. The majority of the country's population lives in poverty. However, many investors and businessmen feared Chavez would reverse the nation's free-market policies. Chavez immediately instituted major changes in the government, including reducing the size of government, reviewing the country's oil policies, and convening an assembly to rewrite the constitution. The political establishment was greatly upset by the announcement regarding the rewriting of the constitution, fearing that the process was a power grab. Leading Venezuelan writer, Arturo Uslar Pietri, accused Chavez of imposing authoritarian rule in a democratic country. The fears turned to fact. Under the new constitution, Chavez can run for two six-year terms. He will have military backing and ability to appoint judges and court officials. He also announced changes in economic policies for purposes of reducing the national debt. Chavez has initiated relations with many countries. He has tried to establish good relations with the US where he had previously been banned. US officials did attempt to improve relations. He reached out to Cuba and China, fellow socialist countries and tried to strengthen relationships with Caribbean and Latin American nations. However, he created problems with the US and with neighbor, Bolivia, over minor border-crossing issues.", "Hugo Chavez was elected President of Venezuela in December 1998 and sworn in on February 2, 1999. He was described as a populist and vowed to root out corruption, subordinate the state oil company to domestic priorities, raise the minimum wage, cut the government payroll, reduce the deficit, and honor the national debt. His foreign policy was aimed at \"peace, integration and defense of human rights\". He wanted Venezuela to play an important role in Latin America, maintain closer ties to Cuba, and continue the one-China policy. The stock market jumped after his election and the currency strengthened. Within a year he was able to get a new constitution approved and dissolve the current Congress. He also began selling government assets to finance social programs. His election was celebrated with dancing in the streets, but the middle and upper classes were terrified of what he would do. One critic said he would push the country back into the past. Investors and businessmen were fearful and within a year almost $4 billion had left the country. A number of oil executives quit. External reactions included one diplomat who said that making Congress more representative would give him a good start. Colombia was not happy with his policy of forcing Colombian truck drivers to turn their vehicles over to Venezuelan drivers at the border. Several small US oil producers filed a lawsuit.

What is being done to combat them?", "summaries": ["The population of Kenya has been plagued by several deadly and debilitating diseases. One out of ten children die from preventable diseases before age five. The number one problem is HIV/AIDS, which has reached disaster proportions, killing nearly 500 Kenyans daily. Most victims are age 15 to 49 years. This has had a significant effect on the workforce and reduced the gross domestic product. UNICEF, The World Bank, and several foreign nations have given money and technical advice to declare war on HIV. The primary strategies are educating the youth of Kenya and the distribution of condoms. Malaria is the number two killer in Kenya. For example, in April, 1997, 333 people in the Rift Valley and neighboring Nyanza provinces died of the disease. The Kenyan government has responded by using sulphur-based drugs to treat malaria instead of the usual chloroquin-based medication. The malaria infection has grown resistant to the latter. Many of the common communicable diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, typhoid, and dysentery, are related to food deficiencies and contaminated water. Many die of malnutrition and even starvation. Kenya has been meeting with other African nations for the purpose of improving public health and fighting disease. Experts from South Africa are doing field studies in Kenya for the purpose of identifying certain unknown communicable diseases and finding treatment. In recent years, cases of heart attacks and coronary disease have increased tenfold in Kenya. The increase has been attributed to smoking, lack of exercise, excess body weight, and psychological stress.", "HIV/AIDS is a major problem in Kenya where, in 1999, 1.9 million people were afflicted. The nation has a National AIDs and STI (sexuality transmitted infection) Program. The World Bank provided $46 million for a program to enhance awareness of this scourge. The UN Children's Fund declared war on AIDS and urged churches to join. Money was sought for treatment and education initiatives. Free condom dispensers were installed in public areas. In 2000, public policy was being reviewed to address environmental, sanitary, and housing problems and \"loopholes\" that encouraged the spread of this disease. Malaria also is a major health problem with 3 million cases in Africa each year. The World Health Organization was helping with the fight. Anti-malaria campaigns are run and drugs are distributed. Kenya was bringing in sulphur-based drugs since some strains of the parasite were chloroquin resistant. Other water borne diseases include typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and hemorrhagic fever. Kenyans are urged to boil their water. The Japan International Agency was providing money for research and control of infectious diseases. The population is less able to fight these diseases because of malnutrition. Eight percent of children die by age 5 because of malnutrition. Kenya and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization sponsored a workshop in 1999. The nation has greatly increased the number of heart specialists who treat coronary artery disease, which is afflicting the more affluent; rheumatic heart disease in the poor; and congenital defects. Used clothing must be certified safe to prevent fungal diseases.", "The leading killer diseases in Kenya are HIV/AIDS and malaria. Since the first case of AIDS was discovered in Kenya in 1980, 1.5 million of over 30 million people are HIV positive. One in nine are infected within the 15-49 age group and 18% of girls 15-19 are infected every year. With one in seven workers in Kenya HIV positive, the productive age group is in danger of being wiped out. 700,000 children have been orphaned by AIDS. The numbers are expected to reach 1.5 million by 2005. AIDS is expected to reduce Kenya's GDP by 14.5% by 2005. 80% of hospital beds are occupied by AIDS patients at a cost of $2.7 million daily. Life expectancy could be reduced from currently 58 years to 42 years by 2010. About 70% of Africans are afflicted by malaria, which kills some two million annually. Some 20 million Kenyans contract malaria every year. Thousands died in 1999 and in the first quarter some 5,000 patients have been hospitalized with 71 deaths reported. In Kenya, one out of ten children die before age 5 mainly from malaria, diarrhea and malnutrition. Malaria spreads frequently because of floods, heavy rains and famine, and recovery is minimized by lack of medial supplies and communication and widespread malnutrition. Kenya receives financial and technical aid from the World Bank and Japan for R&D about AIDS. South Africa and Horn of Africa countries are developing joint strategies against communicable disease, and Kenya has stepped up its public health programs.", "Residents of Kenya continue to be plagued by the diseases they have struggled with for many years: malaria, typhoid dysentery, tuberculosis, cholera, diarrhea, Rift Valley fever and malnutrition. Heart attacks are on the rise. The greatest threat to life and health, however, has been the spread of HIV/AIDS. The more \"traditional\" diseases continue to cause death and lingering sickness but the impact of HIV/AIDS has raised Kenyan misery to new heights. It is reported that 500 persons die from HIV/AIDS each day. HIV/AIDS has created a million orphans in that country. The advance of this dreaded disease is expected to lower a Kenyan's life expectancy that stands as 58 years in 1998 to only 42 years by 2010. The Gross Domestic Product has lost 14.5%. One of every ten children born in Kenya now dies from a preventable disease before the age of five. The children die mainly from malaria, diarrhea, vomiting and malnutrition. Some positive steps are being taken. In cooperation with several of its African neighbors Kenya is assessing the magnitude of diseases affecting it and nearby countries. Kenya has increased the number of cardiologists for treating heart disease. They are providing free condoms to stem the advance of HIV/AIDS. Anti-malarial drugs are replacing those whose effectiveness has diminished. Kenya is receiving aid from international organizations like the World Bank and the World Health Organization and from the United States and Japan.

Solar energy is the most affordable way to bring electricity to remote or hard-to-wire areas that are \"off the grid\", such as deserts, jungles and mountains. Solar boats could open up waterways that have been banned to human use because of associated pollution. Sunny places like North China have great solar energy potential. Solar energy is popular in developing countries worldwide, including Cameroun, Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Somalia, Uganda, and Vietnam. It is used in heating, cooling, lighting, cooking, refrigeration, telecommunications, meteorology, earthquake forecasts, and forest fire prevention. Countries that have made advancements in solar energy, such as Israel, Germany, Japan, and Canada, are assisting with solar energy development in China and Africa. China is also aiding African solar energy development. In the next 10 years, 253 cooperative solar demonstration projects are to be launched worldwide. Australia is a leader in solar energy research, with Australian universities developing efficient ultra-thin solar cells and high-tech material for solar thermal electricity. The US leads in solar equipment manufacturing. It also leads in solar energy production, followed by Japan and Europe. Germany is expanding solar cell production. China is a major solar energy producer and sells it at home and abroad. The Netherlands is increasing its solar energy use and installing collectors on rooftops. Israel is a leading solar energy user and does extensive research and development. Brazil and Mexico are major solar power consumers.", "Because the sun provides clean, renewable, and decentralized power, solar energy is an important social economic asset in developing nations with a good portion of their population scattered in remote rural areas heretofore difficult to supply with traditional power. Technology advances, cost reductions, and growing environmental concerns are also beginning to make it more attractive. It is low polluting and reduces dependence on fossil fuels. For the two billion people worldwide who are not connected to power lines, solar energy is often the affordable way to get electricity. It is used extensively in Asia and Africa. In southwest China it is widely used in telecommunication, meteorology, earthquake forecasts, and forest fire prevention. In Europe, Netherlands, which has little space for wind turbines but lots of rooftops, uses it to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. In Latin America, Brazil and Mexico are big buyers of solar power equipment due to the large part of their populations in remote areas. A world summit on solar energy to be held in 1996 in Harare. Examples of cooperation between nations include Israel's working with China to reduce serious pollution by replacing chemical energy with solar energy; Israel also working with Zimbabwe, where solar energy development infrastructure is at an advanced stage; China sending solar energy equipment to Zimbabwe; Japan cooperating with China to bring solar energy to China's less-developed areas; Canada exporting its solar-energy board technology to China. U.S. is the leading producer, with competition from Australia, Japan, Germany, and Israel.", "Solar energy use is internationally wide-spread in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Egypt, Germany, India, Indonesia, Inner Mongolia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Singapore, Somalia, Thailand, Tibet, Vietnam, Uganda, the U.S., Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Low-pollution solar energy powers land and water vehicles. Regions off electric grids have solar-powered streetlights; lighting, heating and cooling for homes, schools, small-scale businesses, hotels; remote leisure, archeological and eco-tourism sites, agricultural buildings; medical facilities; televisions, radios, refrigerators, water heaters, desalinization and water purification systems, relays for telecommunications, meteorology, earthquake forecasting, fire prevention, water pumping. Countries can create low start-up cost industries to produce and sell solar-energy products and services. At the request of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, a World Solar Commission summit in Harare in 1996 launched 253 projects for rural electrification, global education and training, water desalinization and purification, information and communication, industrial policy, market penetration and technology transfer. In 1997 Yaounde hosted a solar seminar for 40 African and European nations. Israel, Germany, Japan, and Canada helped China develop a solar projects. Israel helped Zimbabwe with solar energy infrastructure. Japan helped Tibet build a solar power station. China provided solar energy technology to Zimbabwe. Australia leads in many solar research and applications areas. The U.S. is the leading producer of solar panels. Germany's increased solar cell production may surpass the U.S. Yunnan China is a leading producer of solar power and solar panels for international sale.

In 1999, Chicago's murders reached 10-year lows. In Detroit, January through June 1999, murder rose 16.7%; other serious crime declined 15.8% over 12 months. Larceny dropped 25.5%, assault, auto theft, burglary, rape and robbery declined. In Fort Worth, from 1991 to 1998, homicide dropped 61%. In New Orleans, from 1994 to 1999, murder declined over 50%.", "In the mid and late 1990s there was a marked decrease in both violent and non-violent crimes in the United States. Percentage drops, many in the double digits, were recorded for murders, rapes, burglaries, personal theft, vehicle theft, purse snatching and property theft. The greatest decrease was in the Northeast followed by the West, South, and Midwest. The extent of the decrease in murders is illustrated by Chicago being named the murder capital of the US in 1999 after a ten-year low in number of murders. Detroit showed an increase in murders in 1999 but other crimes declined. Crime rates were not always uniform in any of the regions. New York experienced a huge drop in the number of murders but some counties in New York State saw an increase. In California, some regions near Los Angeles had a decrease in crime and others nearby had an increase. In Richmond, Virginia, gun-related crimes decreased by stringent law enforcement under Project Exile. Arrests for drug crimes did increase throughout the country. New Orleans had the nation's worst murder rate in 1994; then the rate there decreased until 2000 when it saw a big jump. New Orleans was not alone that year in having an increase in number of murders. Baltimore, Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia also showed an increase in that year. Two other large cities, Denver and Phoenix showed a decrease in their number of murders in 2000.", "The nation's overall crime rate in 1999 fell for the eighth consecutive year. Statistics show a continuation of a 25-year downward trend in property crime rates. Crime rates involving property, including burglary and motor vehicle theft, dropped 9 percent from 1998 to 1999, decreasing from 217 per 1,000 US households to 198 per 1,000 households. The number of completed burglaries dropped from 38.5 percent per 1,000 households to 34.1 percent per 1,000, an 11.4 percent fall. Between 1993 and 1999, violent crimes in general declined 32.7 percent, while robbery with injury dropped 38.5 percent. Aggravated assault decreased 41.2 percent and rape fell 40 percent. During 1999, three females per 1,000 were raped or sexually assaulted. A total of 16,914 murders were reported in 1998. The rate of murders by firearms fell 33 percent from 1993. Firearms were used in 64.9 percent of the murders in 1998. America's big cities experienced the deepest decline in their crime rate in 1998, with a five percent drop. Suburban counties saw a decrease of four percent while rural areas were down only one percent. New York City's crime rate plummeted with the use of a data sharing tracking system, which fueled a drop in crimes statewide in New York. Murders dropped 55 percent and rapes decline 15 percent. New Orleans, which had the nation's worst murder rate in 1994, has fallen 50 percent since then. The year 2000, however, has shown murder and juvenile violent crime up in Baltimore, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia.", "Nationwide, the number of violent crimes committed decreased each year from 1992 to 1999. The Justice Department announced a 10% drop in personal and property crime in 1999. The rate of violent crimes declined 32.7% that year. Law enforcement and government officials attribute the lower crime rate to a healthy economy, crime prevention programs, less use of crack cocaine, tougher sentencing, and a greater police presence on the street. Richmond, Virginia reduced crime by making gun-related offenses a federal crime. Offenders received longer sentences with less chance of parole. Los Angeles police successfully experimented with curfews in one crime-ridden neighborhood. Officials say that demographics play a role. As baby boomers age, there are fewer people in the 18-40 year old range, the age most likely to engage in criminal activity. Cities, like New York and New Orleans, that had experienced high rates of murder and other violent crimes, proclaimed a significant decrease. Chicago, although experiencing a ten year low in its murder rate, had the most murders per capita in 1998. Atlanta and Detroit also suffer a high number of murders. While crime in general decreased, the number of crimes committed by teenagers rose sharply in the 1990s. Most arrests and imprisonments are not for violent crime, but for possession and sale of drugs, particularly crack cocaine. The War on Drugs guarantees that anyone caught with possession of illegal drugs will serve time in prison. This ruling has filled jails to overflowing, primarily with African-American citizens from impoverished neighborhoods."]}

What are the advantages of each of these drugs and what can be their side effects?", "summaries": ["Until the late 1980s, psychiatric patients had to rely on medicines discovered decades earlier. Prozac was launched in 1988 as a treatment for depression. It has become extremely popular because it is more effective and has fewer side effects than earlier drugs. Also, it is non-toxic. Other drugs of this type are Zoloft, Fluvoxamine, and Paxil. They fail to work in about one third of patients, they are expensive, and some patients report feeling jittery and anxious. Nausea, tremors, sweating and sexual problems are also possible. Prozac may lead some people to consider suicide. Tricyclic drugs dominated antidepressant treatment for 30 years before Prozac. Side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision and constipation. They are also toxic. Tranquilizers Valium and Xanax, widely used in the 1970s, lost popularity when people learned about complications The first drugs for treating schizophrenia were used in the 1950s. Thorazine, Mellaril and Haldol were effective in controlling hallucinations and paranoia, but they had no effect on large numbers of patients and sometimes provoked a clumsy gait, foot tapping and twitching of facial muscles and tongue. Clozapine, which became available in the U.S. in 1989 for schizophrenia, does not cause muscle spasms and is effective in many more patients. But it sometimes causes serious white blood cell deficiency. Patients' blood must be tested regularly. Anafranil treats serious cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder. It sometimes causes seizures, dry mouth, drowsiness, constipation, increased appetite and impotence. Lithium is a widely used treatment for manic-depression.", "Prozac (Fluoxetine) has replaced Valium (which is addictive) as the leading drug for the treatment of depression. Some people using this drug develop insomnia and are jittery and anxious. Nausea, tremors, sweating and sexual problems are also possible. Most troubling is the fear that sin some cases, Prozac use could lead to suicide. Other anti-depressant drugs include Xanax, Seroxat (Prxil), Zoloft (Lustral), Kytril (not FDA approved), and Effextor. Many of these drugs have the same sisde effects as Prozac. The element lithium, as in lithium carbonate is successful for manic depression but one man died using this in a high temperature environment. Clomipraming (Anafranil) is used to treat obsessive-compulsive behavior but leads to dry mouth, drowsiness, constipation, and impotence. Psychosis treatment drugs include Thorazine and Haldol whose side effects include dyskenesia. These two are also used in treatment for Schizophrenia. Chlorprothixene and Haloperidol are psychosis treatment drugs, both of which inhibit sex drive. Additional schizophrenia drugs incude Zofran, Clozapine (Clozaril) which along with Roxiam may cause a blood disorder; Mellaril, Risperidone, Bromoperidol and Remoxpride. Drugs being proposed for treatment of Alzheimer's and dementia are Piracetam, Oxiracetam, Tacrine, physostigmine, and Aviva (linopirdine0. None of these memory enhancing drugs are yet licensed and would do no more than temporarily slow down the mental disorders of Alzheimer's.", "Drugs have been used to treat mental illnesses for many years, beginning with lithium water. Lithium is still used to moderate mood swings in manic-depressive patients. Anxiety and nervousness are treated with tranquilizers. Valium can cause withdrawals or the opposite and could have sexual side effects. The neuroleptic family (Thorazine, Mellaril, Haldol) is used for anxiety and calming hallucinations and clarifying thinking of schizophrenics. These drugs can cause hyperactivity or apathy, blurred vision, and tardive dyskinesia. Risperidone causes less sever spasms. Patients who don't respond to the neuroleptics are given clozapine drugs, which have fewer side effects but still can cause drowsiness, constipation and seizures. A dangerous drop in white blood cells occurs in 2% of the patients. Three families of drugs are used to treat depression. Tricyclics correct chemical imbalances, but may cause dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, fatigue, weight gain, and sexual problems. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are effective, but can increase blood pressure, cause heart failure, and sexual problems. Both are toxic. Non-toxic selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (Prozac, Zolof, Paxil) have fewer side effects, which allow patients to continue taking them. These drugs are very expensive and considered a psychopharmacological cosmetic, changing personalities in weeks. Some believe they lead to suicides and can cause insomnia, anxiety and sexual problems. Clomipramine eases obsessive-compulsive disorders but causes dry mouth, drowsiness, constipation, and sexual problems. Nortriptyline can ease postpartum depression, but may cause suicide. Prozac also treats eating disorders. Carbamazepine treats depression and also may reduce carvings for cocaine.", "Until the 1990s, patients suffering from depression and other mental disorders relied on drugs such as Valium and Xanax which often had major side effects such as patient drowsiness and sluggishness. The side effects of anti-schizophrenic medicines such as Thorazine used before l990 included tics and twitches, motor disturbances, persistent restlessness and even heart failure. In the 1990s a new class of drugs came on the market, the most popular of which was Prozac. A similar drug, Zoloft, also became commonly used in the treatment of depression. Both medications have greatly improved the lives of those suffering from depression. Prozac can have side effects of insomnia, anxiety, weight gain, nausea, and sexual problems, but is mostly considered a safe drug. The Church of Scientology, however, has associated Prozac with incidences of suicide and filed a suit to have Prozac removed from the market. Manufacturer, Eli Lilly, found no relationship between Prozac and suicide in their trials. The new generation of drugs for treatment of schizophrenia include risperidone and bromoperidol. They promise to help those suffering from the disease to lead a normal life. Another medication, clozapine is being used with people with severe schizophrenia. It is limited to cases not responsive to other medication because it can cause a fatal blood disorder. In 1990, The FDA approved a drug to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder. The drug is clomipramine sold under the trade name of Anafranil. Anafranil is associated with side effects such as dry mouth, drowsiness, constipation, increased appetite, and impotence."]}
{"id": "D0611B", "query": "What methods or products are used to control pests for organic gardens or farms?  Include information on methods of controlling such pests as insects or fungus which do not involve the use of chemical pesticides and are accepted by organizations which certify organic produce for the marketplace.", "summaries": ["Organic gardening and farming avoids using pesticides to control pests. Instead, pests are controlled by a variety of methods and products, such as using certain beneficial organisms and using modern organic farming techniques. Whether the resulting produce is certified as organic for the marketplace is uncertain because certification is the subject of continuing debate and disagreement. Beneficial organisms used include: trichogramma (insect egg parasites) to kill corn borers and bollwevils; spiders for killing pests on grain farms; nematodes (soil-dwelling worms) to control arugula-eating flea bettles; ladybugs to kill tree pests; Bacillus thuringiensis (an insecticidal bacteria) to control Colorado potato beetles; entomophagous fungi to treat the coffee broca that eats coffee berries; chickens to eat bugs, including Japanese beetles; and insect predators as tricho gamma wasps and green lace wings. Among the farming techniques used are: placing traps and covers to keep flea beetles from damaging crops; planting trap crops, as flowers and alfalfa, alongside cash crops and planting flowers in vegetable gardens to attract beneficial insects; planting marigolds to control nematodes; planting basil and tomatoes together because basil repels worms; planting a mixed pattern of rice types in a field rather than one type to control rice blast; using garlic and hot pepper sprays to repel pests; catching by hand and killing flea beetles; using pheromones to confuse fruitworms that feed on cranberries; laying clear plastic over soil to destroy nematodes and other harmful organisms; and pruning branches to limit coffee rust fungus and to kill the eggs of pests.", "Many organic gardeners feel pests mainly attack stressed or sick plants. They keep plants healthy and stress-free by careful tending including good light and moisture control. Methods of controlling insect pests in organic plantings include natural predators such as spiders, wasps, praying mantises, ladybugs, ants, jumping spiders, chickens, and parasitic nematodes. Organic gardeners also use fauna such as garlic, aromatic herbs, French marigolds, plants in the onion family such as chives and garlic, basil, natural and developed fungi. Other insect pest control methods include repeated defoliation, hot pepper spray, row covers, sticky traps, vacuuming, avoiding beetle season, and the use of \"trap crops\" like alfalfa to lure bugs away from \"cash crops\" like strawberries. For moth worms that eat cranberry crops farmers use replicated moth pheromones in liquid form to sexually confuse the moths and prevent the mating and subsequent laying of eggs which become worms and eat cranberry plants. Organic farmers also use trichogrammas, whatever that is. For fungi pests organic farmers resort to pruning, \"cooking\" the soil with solar heat via plastic ground covers, and biodiverse planting. Approved pesticides for organic gardens include botanical pesticides like neem, rotenone, and pyrethrum. Spray applications of Bacillus thuringiensis var. san diego or var. tenebrionsis have been developed for organic gardens. A \"balanced farm ecosystem\", as recommended by the philosophy of biodynamics, will control pests. [Nothing specific is mentioned.]", "One of the major approaches of organic pest control is to use natural enemies of the offender. For instance, trichogamma wasps effectively control corn borers, praying mantises and ladybugs take care of aphids, and spiders and ants protect against leaf-eating insects. The Chinese Academy of Agriculture has bred over a dozen species of insects for pest control. And in Washington, Virginia an organic farmer regularly releases thousands of chickens to eat bugs and fertilize crops at the same time. Another method is to use other plants to protect crops. French marigolds suppress nematodes and basil planted near tomatoes protects the crop from worms. Alfalfa will attract the lygus bug from nearby strawberries. Instead of spraying chemical insecticides the organic farmer can spray with natural substances such as the fungus entomophagous produced from cooked rice to control the coffee broca worm. The sparganothis fruit worm is controlled in cranberry bogs with an artificial replication of the female worm's pheromones which attract the male for mating. Added to the irrigation system the scent permeates the bog and completely confuses the mating process depleting the population. Plastic covering of fields during summer months can kill harmful organisms in the soil in preparation for a winter crop and plastic netting can protect some crops. More prosaic approaches include pruning and destroying affected portions of plants and picking and crushing offending insects, eggs, worms, or grubs.", "Organic farmers employ a variety of natural pest control methods. Natural predators like spiders, trichogamma wasps, green lacewings, praying mantises, and ladybugs are used because they eat harmful insects like aphids, corn borers and bollworms. Farmers set loose thousands of chickens into fields to eat bugs. Organic farmers control flea beetles with garlic, aromatic herbs, hot pepper sprays, mustard oil-baited traps, protective netting, vacuuming the insects off crops, and fall planting. They use companion crops like French marigolds to control nematodes; basil to repel tomato-eating worms; onion family plants to repel aphids; bug-resistant wild spinach to protect cultivated spinach; and flowers and alfalfa to attract beneficial insects to strawberry crops and control the lygus bug, which prefers alfalfa. Chinese farmers plant rice crops in a mixed pattern. Since different types of rice blast attack different varieties of rice, the fungus has a harder time finding a compatible host. Bacteria are used to kill Colorado potato beetle larvae, as is rotenone, a mild botanical poison. For coffee trees, a natural fungus is sprayed on to control worms. Scientists have used replicated pheromones to interfere with the reproduction of the Sparganothis fruit worm. Chinese farmers use a biological preparation on crops rather than chemical pesticides. Other pest management methods such as mulching, weeding, pruning, handpicking pests, fall planting, and maintaining balanced farm ecosystems are effective. Another is the use of solarized soil where sheets of plastic are laid over the soil to trap solar heat for six weeks to kill harmful organisms."]}

The virus killed 7 and sickened 77 in New York City. Horses on Long Island also died and afflicted birds were found in New Jersey, Connecticut, and Baltimore. After the winter, the virus again appeared in New York City, New Jersey, and Connecticut, then in June in Delaware, and in July in Boston. The first human victim for 2000 was on Staten Island and the virus began spreading into New York State. Afflicted birds were found in Rhode Island in August and in Baltimore and Philadelphia in September. Seventeen people contracted the disease, one died. The virus was expected in Georgia and North Carolina and 17 eastern states were on alert. The West Nile virus was discovered in 1937 in Uganda and the U.S. strain probably came from Israel. It is transmitted by mosquitoes, which bite infected birds then spread it to other birds, people and other animals. Control focused on detection, mosquito elimination, and personal protection. Detection consisted of testing mosquitoes, dead birds, and people who appeared ill. \"Sentinel\" chickens were kept down the east coast and tested weekly. Insecticides were sprayed over threatened areas and larvacides were placed in water. People were urged to install window screens, stay inside in the early morning and evening, wear long sleeves and pants, use DEET insect repellent, remove standing water, and keep grass short.", "The first diagnosed case of West Nile virus in humans was in the summer of 1999 in New York City. Seven New Yorkers died of the disease that summer. West Nile virus, which causes flu-like symptoms or encephalitis, is transmitted by Culex mosquitoes who have been in contact with virus-carrying birds. It can cause death in very young or elderly victims. West Nile is not transferred person to person. After the first outbreak, there was great fear that the virus would be spread by migrating birds. In the summer of 2000, infected birds were found in New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts. Many state agricultural departments began regular random testing of wild birds and domestic fowl. The Center for Disease Control coordinated the testing effort. US Senator, Joseph Lieberman, of Connecticut proposed a unified Federal response to the problem including accelerated research for a possible vaccine. Currently state officials are urging citizens to take simple precautions to protect from mosquito bites. They include staying indoors at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active, wearing long sleeve shirts and long pants, and using insect repellent. Officials also urge the removal of stagnant water, a favorite breeding ground of mosquitoes. New York and New Jersey, in particular, have been heavily spraying regions where mosquitoes breed with insecticides, such as Anvil or Permethrin, to kill larvae. Environmental groups have protested the thorough spraying, fearing that the insecticide, a carcinogen, is a greater danger to humans than the West Nile virus.", "West Nile virus was first detected in the United States in August 1999. Discovery of the virus occurred in Uganda in 1937. For many years, the virus was found only in Africa, parts of Asia and Eastern Europe. Humans, birds and horses are subject to the disease. The virus is transmitted by bites from infected mosquitoes. The disease cannot be contacted person-to-person or by handling birds with the disease or having died from it. The disease discovered in Queens, New York, may have been brought to the US in infected birds from Israel, since the particular virus strain is similar to that found in Israel. Another theory is the virus \"escaped\" from the Sloan-Kettering Institute where the virus had been provided for experimental treatments. Over 60 individuals in the New York contacted the disease and seven, all elderly, died. Within weeks, the disease spread to nearby New Jersey and Connecticut. Scientists feared that the virus would soon appear in areas to the south of New York based on bird migratory patterns. Within the first year after discovery in the US the West Nile virus had killed thousands of wild birds from Massachusetts to Maryland. Controlling the spread of the West Nile virus is dependent upon killing the mosquitoes that can infect with the virus. Spraying likely mosquito breeding areas is being done in the Northeast with pesticides and larvacides. Plans are being developed in the southern US for spraying in anticipation of the spread of the virus southward.", "West Nile virus was first detected in the U.S. in New York City in September 1999. Genetically linked to a strain in Israel, it spread in the area at an alarming rate. Initially, West Nile was blamed for three deaths. Immediately the count rose to five deaths and at least 38 sickened in New York City and neighboring counties. The virus also killed scores of birds in New York and Connecticut, including 20 zoo birds. In October, dead birds in New Jersey tested positive. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut sprayed insecticides in the fall, hoping to kill infected mosquitoes before winter. Officials set up mosquito surveillance and applied larvacide in the spring. In January 2000, the human toll was adjusted to seven dead and over 60 sickened. The virus also killed hundreds of birds and at least nine horses. By April, health officials as far as Florida had set up West Nile virus surveillance. In June, infected birds were discovered in New York, New Jersey, and Delaware. In July, West Nile was found in Connecticut and Massachusetts. By August, it reached Maryland and Rhode Island. Three people in Staten Island, New York contracted the virus, and 11 tests in New Jersey were pending. In July, the Senate proposed a unified federal response plan. Insecticide spraying to kill adult mosquitoes was conducted throughout the spring and summer wherever the virus was detected. Residents were urged to protect themselves and pets from mosquito bites and empty outdoor containers of standing water."]}

Ten years after the conclusion of war, Britain and Argentina are again in dispute over the waters around the Falkland Islands. Britain has begun seismic studies in hopes of drilling for oil in the waters surrounding the islands. Argentina wants results of the survey negotiations. Britain has agreed to cooperate with Argentina because they will need to use Argentinian land for the supporting the oil industry. There also been disputes between the two countries over fishing rights. A third dispute over territorial rights involving oil is between Greece and Turkey regarding the continental shelf under the Aegean Sea. Greece has opened the way for oil exploration, but has agreed to international arbitration regarding seabed mineral rights. They have rejected Turkey's proposals for joint exploration of the area. A territorial dispute has been settled between Denmark and the Faroe Islands. The Danish government has agreed to hand over all mineral rights to the Faroese government. Another potential dispute could be over oil rights in Crimea in the Black Sea currently controlled by Britain, but with interest from the Ukraine, American, Dutch, and Norwegian companies.", "Britain and Argentina both claim Falkland Island territorial waters, suspected of oil reserves. Argentina used a fisheries dispute to press for participation in development. Britain and Argentina discussed joint-venture exploration. Vietnam and China have battled over undersea oil and gas exploitation around the Spratly Islands, partially claimed also by Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei. China claimed sovereignty over the area and drilled in Vietnamese waters. Vietnam drilled nearby. ASEAN successfully urged restraint and suggested a joint development zone similar to Thailand and Malaysia's. China tentatively agreed. Greece and Turkey dispute offshore oil rights in the Aegean. Greece rejected Turkish proposals for joint Aegean exploration. An international court of arbitration lifted a drilling moratorium on waters around Saint-Pierre and Miquelon islands, disputed by France and Canada, allowing Canada to award oil contracts. Gas and oil exploration around the Faroe Islands was blocked by Denmark's dispute with the Faroese over mineral rights and its claim that Britain's demarcation line was too close. Denmark threatened to go to the International Court. Denmark ceded mineral rights to the Faroese. Denmark, Britain and Iceland all claim Rockall Island, suspected of containing oil. An unsettled Ukrainian-Russian territorial dispute threatened the first deep Black Sea offshore oil well. The 1994 UN LOS convention encourages resource exploitation compromise in unresolved maritime disputes, citing an Australian-Indonesian accord over Timor's waters. One party cannot exploit territory-straddling oil deposits without damaging another's interests. After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and its oilfields, a UN Commission proposed giving Kuwait several Iraqi wells.", "China and Vietnam agreed, in 1994, to work peacefully to resolve their disputes over the Spratly atolls and waters of the South China Sea. Both countries had awarded oil exploration contracts to U.S. oil companies in the area. Five other nearby countries also claimed the Spratlys, and spokesmen for some of them accused China of \"bullying\" them in an effort to fill the power vacuum left by the reduction of US troops and Russia's retreat from the region. China's foreign minister said the two sides could start \"joint development\" if talks failed. In 1994, British Gas and YPF, Argentina's privatized oil company, discussed a joint venture to explore for hydrocarbons in South Atlantic waters between Argentina and the Falkland Islands. But talks stalled because of disagreement between Britain and Argentina on sovereignty over the Falklands. Although Argentina was defeated in the 1982 war with Britain over the Falklands, it still claimed the islands. Tensions flared in 1994 between Greece and Turkey when the UN's Law of the Sea went into effect allowing nations to claim territorial waters and their resources, 12 miles out. Turkey declared it was ready to take up arms to prevent Greece from claiming Aegean waters 12 miles from its shoreline.

Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei also claim to some of Islands. China has signed an agreement with a US energy company to begin exploration for oil in that area. China has also entered into an area in the Gulf of Tonkin claimed by Vietnam. The six countries laying some claim to the disputed area have proposed a regional settlement. Later, China and Vietnam agreed to work peacefully to resolve territorial and maritime boundaries and consider joint development. Argentina was initially excluded from oil exploration around the Falkland Islands by Britain. Fishing rights were also at issue. Eventually, Britain and Argentina agreed to hold talks on joint oil exploration in that area. A United Nations Commission settled the border issue between Kuwait and Iraq over oilfields after the Gulf War. An international court of arbitration settled a dispute between France and Canada over territorial water around two French islands in the Atlantic. Canada was awarded oil rights. Greece and Turkey have both claimed oil exploration rights in the Aegean. Arguments between Russia and Ukraine over the Crimea have affected oil exploration there. The Danish government has agreed to give the Faroe Islands mineral rights. Evidence of oil may enter into the dispute between Britain and Iceland over fishing rights in the waters around Rockall."]}
{"id": "D0643G", "query": "Describe the causes and effects of the El Nino and La Nina weather condition. What programs and scientific techniques are in effect to better predict and cope with the conditions?", "summaries": ["El Nino and El Nina are opposite extremes of continuous but far ranging changes in water surface temperature, precipitation, trade winds, and sea level in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, which portend extreme changes and reversals in usual global climate and weather patterns, resulting in dangerous temperature changes, storms, floods and droughts world wide, with severe economic impacts, disease and death. These phenomena even slow the Earth's rotation, which has long-term global climate implications. The following programs are in effect to study and predict these phenomena, their indicators, consequences, and the possible remediation of their catastrophic effects: Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science; Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization; the U.N.'s World Meteorological Organization; in the U.S. the National Weather Service, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Union College, and the University of Syracuse; Germany's Max Plank Institute for Meteorology; China's National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center and the Marine Environmental Protection Department of the State Oceanic Administration; Bangladesh's Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization; an unspecified, but inferably internationally operated Pacific-wide El Nino detection system; and many private climate and weather forecasting companies. Scientific technologies and techniques for studying these phenomena include: computer modeling, simulation and forecasting of global climate and weather; onsite and remote satellite measurement of changes in weather data, deep ocean waves, sea level, surface temperature, greenhouse gas concentrations, clouds, rain, severe storms, sun spot activity, and sediment layers; and weather-correlated epidemiological studies.", "El Nino is a disruptive weather phenomenon that usually occurs every three to four years on the average. It involves a surface warming of the eastern and central Pacific Ocean around the equator when trade winds weaken. It can disrupt climate around the world, producing extra rain in the southeastern U.S., Peru and Ecuador during the winter, while causing drought in the western Pacific as well as the slowing of trade winds and changes in sea levels. Basically, it reverses normal weather patterns, resulting in drought in usually wet locations and flooding in arid areas. It also helps trigger some man-made disasters, such as forest fires, and enhances conditions that cause viral disease among humans and livestock. La Nina is the phenomenon of rapidly cooling equatorial waters in the central Pacific. It develops every several years and works in reverse of El Nino. It can last for one year causing cooler conditions in central North America and dry warm conditions in the southern states that can be just as disruptive as El Nino. On the positive side, El Nino can be credited with saving lives that would have been lost in normal winter and hurricane seasons. It may also help cut global warming by temporarily stemming release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific Ocean. Computer module studies and satellite systems allow for a better understanding of how El Nino and La Nina form but, unfortunately, when they will develop or what they hold for the future still cannot be predicted.", "El Nino is a periodic weather phenomenon caused by abnormal warming of the water in the eastern Pacific. This warming changes the winds and atmospheric pressure, shifting weather patterns and reducing carbon dioxide release. It can cause storms in California, tornadoes in Florida, a mild winter in the northern states, and reduce the number of Atlantic hurricanes. It also can cause storms and flooding in South America and Africa, droughts in Indonesia, and flooding in China. Increased water borne illnesses in Africa and decreased milk production in California have also been attributed to El Ninos. La Nina is the opposite condition. There is abnormal cooling of the Pacific sea surface creating a colder, stronger jet stream in the upper atmosphere. During La Nina the northeast is wet and cold, the southwest is exceptionally dry, and the east is abnormally warm. There are more tornados and thunderstorms in the mid-west and more hurricanes in the Atlantic. Northern South America is wet, while the southern part of the continent is dry. Scientists around the world are trying to understand, track, and predict these phenomena. NASA satellites measure sea surface temperatures. The El Nino detection system consists of 70 buoy-borne stations monitoring Pacific winds and waves. Scientists in the United States, Australia, Israel, and Germany are using sophisticated computer simulations. Some Chinese are seeking links between El Nino and sunspot cycles. A 30-foot-long cylinder of mud from a South American lakebed is being analyzed to track the weather cycles back 15,000 years.", "The El Nino weather pattern occurs when weakening trade winds allow warm water in the western Pacific to pulse to the east. It usually occurs around December every 3-6 years. Global warming and sunspot activity have been linked to El Nino. El Nino causes reversals of normal weather patterns worldwide, resulting in drought in usually wet locales and flooding in arid areas. Trade winds may reverse direction. Days may lengthen because of Earth's rotation. Increased precipitation from El Nino brings upsurges in diseases such as cholera, malaria, dengue fever, and Rift Valley fever. El Nino helped make 1998 the hottest year on record. Its effects on mortality and the economy are mixed. El Nino may lessen global warming by temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific. La Nina alternates with El Nino and is fueled by abnormally cold water in the eastern Pacific. It typically lasts a year. La Nina reverses El Nino's effects but also brings drought to some parts of the planet while drenching others. It is associated with colder temperatures on the US West Coast. Predicting El Nino and its behavior is aided by computer modeling, a detection system that monitors Pacific winds and waves through 70 stations floating on buoys, and weather satellites that detect ocean warming. Private forecasting companies who sell predictions to businesses are pushing forecasting frontiers. Forecasting El Nino behavior allows farmers to vary sowing and planting periods and vaccinate livestock, and mosquito habitats to be treated with insecticides."]}
{"id": "D0602B", "query": "Discuss the prevalence of steroid use among female athletes over the years. Include information regarding trends, side effects and consequences of such use.", "summaries": ["Increasing numbers of female athletes use anabolic steroids. Among female college athletes, an estimated 5% in swimming, 6% in basketball and 10% in track and field have used steroids. The fastest growing group of users is adolescent females. New steroids are often marketed as dietary supplements and girls are unaware of what they are taking. A young tennis player tested positive for steroids after taking an \"all natural\" supplement later discovered to contain a variation on the banned steroid nandrolone. A former Olympic track coach believes at least 40% of the U.S. women's team in Seoul had used steroids at some time. Because of their naturally low testosterone levels, steroids have a more dramatic effect on women, boosting their levels up to 10 times. The health effects can be dramatic, including liver damage and tumors, elevated cholesterol, heart attacks, strokes, stunted growth in adolescents, infertility, uncontrollably violent behavior, chronic depression, deeper voices, excessive facial hair, and acne. Many East German female athletes were given steroids, often unbeknownst to them or their parents and suffered serious side-effects. Athletes who have tested positive for steroids include a Bulgarian triple jumper, a Romanian hammer thrower, a Russian runner, a Dominican high, a Jamaican sprinter, a Spanish pole vaulter, a German marathon runner, two Moroccan athletes, and two Chinese Taipei weightlifters. A number of female Chinese athletes have tested positive, including several swimmers and rowers. International organizations impose bans of between two months and life on athletes found guilty of using illegal steroids.", "Steroids have been in increasing use since first observed in international competition in 1956. Used legitimately for some diseases, steroids are used to build up muscles, strength, and endurance, and are taken by female as well as male athletes. The relative newness of women's sports allows countries to make inroads more quickly than in men's athletics. With the lure of scholarships and professional ventures there is more at stake now than ever for female athletes. Use of steroids by 8-12th grade girls has gone up 100% from 1996 to 1998. During the 1990's they were in widespread use in international competitions, affecting women athletes from many nations and sports fields. Steroids increase the amount of testosterone, which is dramatic in women because of the small amount in their bodies originally. However, there are many side effects, including liver damage, increase in facial hair, voice changes, acne, sterility, enlarged Adam's apple, shrinkage of the uterus, gynecological problems, elevated cholesterol, aggressive behavior, and stunted growth in younger users. The consequences of steroid use, physically, are strain on liver, kidneys, and heart, leading to vascular damage and risks of blood-clotting, stroke, and heart attack. Abnormal incidences of cancer, birth defects, and depression have also been associated with steroid use. Legal and professional consequences include suspension and banning from competitions, dropping from teams, fines, loss of promotional contracts, and loss of awards and medals. Coaches and doctors who administer steroids to unknowing athletes risk fines or prison.", "The most famous anabolic steroids use by female athletes was the systematic doping of the East German Olympic teams from 1974 to 1989. The East German officials and coaches were prosecuted for this doping following the reunification of Germany. China and the former Soviet Union also used steroids as a governmental policy. The use of steroids by coaches and individuals, especially professionals, has been seen in many women's sports around the world. By 1999, teenaged girls in the United States became the fastest growing group of steroid users. Studies estimated 13% of high school athletes and 2.6% of girls in several middle schools were using the drugs. The side effects of these drugs are deeper voices, serious acne, excessive hair growth, depression, and aggressiveness. Some women become sterile and some have children with birth defects. Side effects also can include heart disease, liver damage including tumors and cancer, and premature death. One consequence of using these drugs is winning as the East Germans proved, going from 20 medals in the 1972 Olympics to 40 in 1976. Extensive and complicated testing is employed in an attempt to catch the users. If caught, individuals and at times teams must forfeit medals, are banned from competition for specific lengths of time, or even are banned from the sport. To avoid detection, new drugs continually are being developed, some labeled nutritional supplements. Some nations monitor their own teams to avoid international embarrassment. By 1999 the quality and rigorousness of Olympic testing was being scrutinized.", "Anabolic steroids made their first impact on athletic competition with the world-record setting performance of the 1956 Russian Olympic team. Performance-enhancing steroids had an allure to both male and female athletes. In the late 1990's, Professor Charles Yesalis of Penn State University estimated steroid use among female athletes as 5 percent in swimming, 6 percent in basketball, and 10 percent in track and field. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey reported that 2.4 percent of female high-school students acknowledged using illegal steroids, compared with 4.9 percent of males. Professor Yesalis estimated in 1998 that about 1 percent of girls in grades 8 through 12 were using anabolic hormones. In 1999, The National Institutes of Drug Abuse said that 500,000 teenagers, 175,000 teenage girls and 325,000 teenage boys, reported using steroids at least once in the past year, a rise of 100 percent since 1991. Anabolic steroid use has numerous risks. They are designed to imitate testosterone or stimulate its production. Testosterone, a male sex hormone induces growth of skeletal muscle. However, the dosage level needed to build muscle puts a strain on the liver, the kidneys, and the heart. Females who use steroids can take on male characteristics, such as increased facial hair and a deep voice; steroid use can also cause gynecological problems. Serious side effects that can occur include liver cancer, heart disease, and uncontrollable aggressiveness. Some effects may not appear for years after steroid use, such as giving birth to babies with deformities as clubfeet."]}
